SAGA Standardization Roadmap
----------------------------

 SAGA is a set of application driven API specification documents.  As
 such, the evolution of SAGA as a standard is relatively straight
 forward: the SAGA Working Group has to continue to update the
 specifications according to newly emerging application use cases, and
 has to adjust the available specifications in respect to end user
 feedback, to implementation experiences, and to the evolving DCI
 landscape.  Additionally, the group should continue to ensure that
 the SAGA specifications are well in sync with related specification
 efforts, on the same or lower levels of abstraction (it is unlikely
 that domain-independent standardization efforts on higher levels will
 be attempted, or would even be sensible/possible).

 ACTION ITEMS (ordered by decreasing priority / timeline):
 
   - TODO: finalize the Resource API Package Spec
   - TODO: write specifications for Java/C++/Python language bindings
   - TODO: write experience documents for Advert/SD/ISN/Resource API
   - TODO: revise SAGA core specification, potentially split it up
   - TODO: sync with BES/JSDL/GLUE/... revisions
   - TODO: *consider* higher level programming models
