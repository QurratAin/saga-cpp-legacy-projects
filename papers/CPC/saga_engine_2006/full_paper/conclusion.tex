We described the C++ reference implementation of the SAGA API, which
is done as a very generic and very extensible library, or rather
framework.  The described techniques come with a certain,
although quite small, overhead.  In grid environments, however,
runtime overhead is vastly dominated by communication latencies, so
that \B{this} overhead \I{does not matter}.  The lesson to be learnt is
that distributed environments \I{allow} for fancy mechanisms, which
would be too expensive in local environments.  Fail safety and latency
hiding mechanisms are enormously more important than, for example,
virtual functions, late binding, and additional abstraction layers.  
In that sense, we hope that the presented library is
of use to other implementors of distributed applications.

% However, memory footprint is supposed to be reasonable, and the
% implementation should allow for zero-copy access to communication
% buffers (that matters for bandwidth dominated communication and
% applied latency hiding techniques).
