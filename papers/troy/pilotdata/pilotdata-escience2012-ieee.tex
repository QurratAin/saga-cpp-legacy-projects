\section{Pilot-Data Overview}

Talk about concept

\begin{itemize}

\item Similar levels of heterogeneity in the data infrastructure

\begin{itemize}
\item File systems, storage, transport protocols, â€¦
\end{itemize}

\item Support application level capabilities to specify dependencies
  at a logical level rather than specific file level

\begin{itemize}
\item First class support for Affinities (D-C, D-D)
\end{itemize}

\item Typically placement and scheduling of data is decoupled from the compute-tasks

\begin{itemize}
\item Integrated approach to compute and data ?
\end{itemize}

\item Dynamic decision for data

\begin{itemize}
\item Analogous  to late-binding of data
\item Fluctuating resources as a fundamental property of DCI
\end{itemize}

\item Abstraction for other factors and not application specific way
\begin{itemize}
\item Varying data sources, fluctuating data rates, etc
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}












Reasoning about PilotData

Implementation

Substantiate with description of design decisions

Pilot-API as a unifying piece


\section{Experiments}

How do we support affinity?

PD on heterogeneous backends

Distributed systems/data

Similar coordination graph as in the past

"Intelligent" data placements:

- ComputeDataService decides whether data, compute or both have to move

- 3 different cases:

i) move all data everywhere

ii) move data when task has been placed

iii) move data and then place task

Assumption:
How is initial data placed?
- distributed
- central in one place

Second application track:
- Data movement in the context of MD jobs

Which application?
- exclusively bfast?
- bwa? another good application?
- in some cases reference data is decomposable...

Look at the difference in $T_c$ for each application in the three
cases. We might introduce the idea of alpha. We dont' need to
quantify, but can qualitatively show how alpha determines the
importance (as measured by time to solution). 

My hunch is that $T_c$ will be more sensitive for data-intensive
application than other way around.

The idea is that for an application which is
