\section{Introduction and Overview} 

\section{Pilot-Data Overview}

Talk about concept

Reasoning about PilotData

Implementation

Substantiate with description of design decisions

\section{Pilot-API}
Pilot-API as a unifying piece


\section{Experiments}

How do we support affinity?

PD on heterogeneous backends

Distributed systems/data

Similar coordination graph as in the past

"Intelligent" data placements:

- ComputeDataService decides whether data, compute or both have to move

- 3 different cases:

i) move all data everywhere

ii) move data when task has been placed

iii) move data and then place task

Assumption:
How is initial data placed?
- distributed
- central in one place

Second application track:
- Data movement in the context of MD jobs

Which application?
- exclusively bfast?
- bwa? another good application?
- in some cases reference data is decomposable...
