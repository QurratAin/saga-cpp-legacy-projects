Troy Paper
----------

Target Journal: ACM Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Computing
Conference Target: HPDC'12

Section 1: Introduction and Background 
  - Why Pilot-Jobs?

Section 2: Troy: An implementation of the Pstar model
   - API, Specific design consideration and CPI
   - Designed for extensibility, interoperability etc
   - Alternative approaches to the problem
   - .. 

Note: S2 should (i) make assumptions explicit, (ii) be sure to not
over-scope claims/assertions, (iii)

Section 3: Experimentation: Troy basic Performance and measurements 
      - Internal characterisation etc
      - Section should/needs to be self-contained

Section 4: Experimentation Applications to test for scalability along,
(i) # of ensembles/tasks, (ii) scale-up in number of pilots, (iii)
number of distributed resources
     - Data Intensive (Genomics/NGS) 
     - Compute Intensive (Replica-Exchange? Ensemble based?) 
     - MapReduce
