  % Distributed cyberinfrastructures (CI) and applications require the
  % ability to determine and utilize resource
  % selection\alnote{selection somehow does not fit} at runtime
  % (dynamically), and not just before execution (statically).
  Pilot-Jobs are arguably one of the most widely-used distributed
  computing abstractions; 
  % they have been utilized on many production distributed
  % cyberinfrastructures.  
  they have been notable in their ability to effectively support
  distributed resource utilization, as measured by the number and
  types of applications that use them, as well as the number of
  production distributed cyberinfrastructures that support them.  Not
  surprisingly, there are multiple, distinct and incompatible
  implementations of pilot-jobs; often these implementations are
  strongly coupled to the distributed cyberinfrastructure they were
  originally designed for.  Additionally, in spite of broad uptake,
  there does not exist a well defined, unifying conceptual framework
  for pilot-jobs which can be used to define, compare and contrast
  different implementations. This presents a barrier to extensibility
  and interoperability. This paper is an attempt to (i) provide a
  minimal but complete model (P*) of pilot-jobs, (ii) establish the
  generality of the P* Model by mapping various existing and well
  known pilot-job frameworks such as Condor and DIANE to P*, (iii)
  derive an interoperable and extensible API for the P* Model
  (Pilot-API), (iv) validate the implementation of the Pilot-API by
  concurrently using multiple {\it distinct} pilot-job frameworks on a
  range of production distributed cyberinfrastructures, and (v) apply
  the P* model to pilot-data.

\section{Introduction and Overview \upp\upp} \note{SJ}

Applications that support dynamic execution have the ability to
respond to a fluctuating resource pool, i.\,e., the set of resources
utilized at time (T), $T=0$ is not the same as $T>0$. Distributed CI
almost by definition is comprised of a set of resources that is
fluctuating -- growing, shrinking, changing in load and capability;
this is in contrast to a static resource utilization model
traditionally a characteristic of parallel and cluster computing.

The ability to utilize a dynamic resource pool is thus an important
attribute of any application that needs to utilize distributed CI
efficiently.  However, even for traditional high-performance/parallel
applications, the evolution or internal dynamics of an application may
vary, thereby changing the resource requirements.  For example,
different solvers, adaptive algorithms and/or implementations, can
also require applications to utilize different set/amounts of
resources.  Thus, the need to support dynamic execution is widespread
for computational science applications.

% time (T), $T=0$ is not the same as $T>0$.


Multiple approaches exist to support dynamic resource utilization, for
example, advanced scheduling (without pre-emption) provides
essentially a guarantee of resources at a sufficiently far out time
window.  However, distributed applications that are able to 
%use tools and services that
break the coupling between workload management and
resource assignment/scheduling have been successful at efficiently
utilizing distributed resources, without the policy-level complexity
of implementing advanced reservations.  A common approach for
decoupling workload management and resource scheduling typically in
user-space (i.e. application-level scheduling) are \emph{pilot-jobs
  (PJ)}.  The PJ abstraction is also a promising route to address
additional, as well as specific requirements of distributed scientific
applications~\cite{ko-efficient,DBLP:conf/hpdc/KimHMAJ10,bigjob_cloudcom10}.


The seamless uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific
applications has been limited by the availability of extensible,
pervasive and simple-to-use abstractions at multiple levels –
development, deployment and execution stages of scientific
applications~\cite{dpagrid2009}.

The general problem applies to the specific situation of pilot-jobs,
i.e., there are many implementations of the PJ abstraction, and
although they are all for the most parts functionally equivalent --
they support the decoupling of workload submission from resource
assignment -- it is often impossible to use them interoperably or even
just to compare them functionally or qualitatively.  Different
projects and users have rolled-out their own PJ abstractions
\jhanote{citations}. The fact that users have voted with their feet
for PJs reinforces that the Pilot-Job abstraction is both a useful and
correct abstraction for distributed CI; the fact that it has become an
``unregulated cottage industry'' reaffirms the lack of common
nomenclature, integration, interoperability and extension.

\jhanote{SJ and AM discussed the analogy with WF. Needs hardening} The
situation is reminiscent of the proliferation of functionally similar
yet incompatible workflow systems.  Reasons are complex and can't be
simplified; but amongst others, it seems difficult to balance the WF
abstraction layer, to avoid (a) the abstraction being too simplifying,
and thus not supporting a large number of 'edge' use cases ('smallest
common denominator'), and (b) the abstraction being too complex, and
cluttered with semantics only useful for a small percentage of use
cases ('greatest common factor').
% Also, maybe interoperability isnt what is desired, but reusability
% and or ease of customisation. 
Given the proliferation of pilot-jobs, and additional sophistication
that can be built upon them, there exist similar risks.

% Interestingly there exist many implementations of the PJ abstraction,

% Pilot-Job is both a useful and correct abstraction for distributed CI;

% reaffirms the lack of common nomenclature, integration,
% interoperability and extension.

Our work is partly motivated by the status of the usage and
availability of the pilot abstraction vis-\`{a}-vis the current
landscape of distributed applications and CI. Our objective is to
provide a minimal, but complete model for the pilot-job abstraction.
This model called the P* Model, can be used to provide an conceptual
framework to compare and contrast different pilot-job
implementations. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such
attempt. We present the P* Model in \S{II}.

% In \S{III} we introduce TROY -- A Tiered Resource OverlaY -- as an
% implementation of the P* Model. TROY provides an API for the P* Model
% and exposes the semantics of PJ frameworks; TROY also has a runtime
% system that enables it to work with different middleware on
% heterogeneous distributed platforms.

% Implementations of PJ frameworks, such as BigJob and DIANE, are
% integrated into TROY via an adaptor mechanism; we posit that the TROY
% framework and API can be used for most, if not all PJ frameworks.

The P* Model captures the essence of of most, if not all PJ
frameworks.  Before validating this claim with empirical evidence, in
\S{III} we analyze and discuss several well-known PJ frameworks (DIANE,
Swift-Coaster and Condor-G) using the analytical framework provided by
the P* Model.  % TROY is also able to manage multiple, potentially
% different pilot-job instances concurrently.

measurements used to characterize the workings of the Pilot-API and to
demonstrate interoperability across middleware, platform and different
PJ frameworks.

Implicit validation of this paper lies in the practical implications
of our work: XXXX is positioned to be used on every major national and
international distributed CI, including NSF XSEDE, NSF/DOE Open
Science Grid, EU EGI amongst others. In \S{V} we validate the
Pilot-API by demonstrating how BigJob, Condor-G~\cite{condor-g} and
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} -- existing and widely used pilot-job
frameworks, can be used through the Pilot-API.
To further substantiate the impact of P*, we will demonstrate 
interoperability between different PJ frameworks -- BigJob and DIANE. We
believe this is also the first demonstration of interoperation of
different pilot-job implementations.

After validating the P* Model -- as measured by extensibility and
interoperability,  we investigate generalizations to the base P*
Model in \ \S\ref{sec:pilot-data}.  A natural and logical extension of
the P* Model, arises from the need to extend it to include data in
addition to computational tasks.  This leads to analogous abstraction
to the pilot-job: the \emph{pilot-data (PD)} abstraction, and the
introduction of the BigData concept. The potentially consistent
treatment of data and compute, suggests symmetrical compute and data
elements in the P* model; thus we refer to this model as the P* model
("P-star").

\section{P* Model: An Abstract Model for Pilot-Abstractions\upp\upp}
\label{sec:pilot-model}

In an attempt to provide a common analytical framework to understand
most, if not all commonly used pilot-jobs, we present the P* model of
pilot-abstractions. The P* model is derived from an analysis of many
pilot-job implementations; based upon this analysis, we first present
the common {\it elements} of the P* model, followed by a description
of the properties that determine the interaction of these elements and
the overall functioning of any pilot-job framework that implements the
P* model. All pilot-job frameworks (whether they adhere rigorously to
the P* model or not), have these {\it elements}, but differ in
specific attributes and characteristics.  Further, we will show that
these elements and interactions can be used to describe a pilot-data
model.
 
Before we proceed to discuss the P* Model, it is important to
emphasize that there exist a set of commonly used terms ---
abstraction, model, framework, and implementation, that are overloaded
and often used inconsistently; thus we establish their context and
usage in this paper.

\emph{Terms and Usage:} The \emph{ abstraction} of a pilot-job
generalizes the reoccuring concept of utilizing a placeholder job as a
container for a set of compute tasks; instances of that placeholder
job are commonly referred to as \emph{pilot-jobs} or
\emph{pilots}. The P* \emph{model} provides a % specific,
comprehensive description of pilot-job abstractions based on a set of
identified elements and their interactions. The P* model can be used
as a {\it conceptual model}, for analyzing different implementations
of the pilot-job abstraction. It is important to distinguish P* which
provides a conceptual (abstract) model from an implementation of the
P* model; the \emph{Pilot-API} exposes a sub-set of the P* elements
and characteristics to applications. Finally, a \emph{pilot-job
  framework} refers to a specific instance of a pilot-job
implementation and associated infrastructure that provides the
complete pilot-job functionality (e.\,g.\ Condor-G and DIANE).  The
term "pilot-job system" could have been used as well, but past
experience shows that even with ``system'', there remains scope for
confusion between the pilot-job itself and associated infrastructure
(e.g, the literature abounds with inconsistent usage of the term
``workflow systems'').

\noindent 
\subsection{Elements of the P* Model \upp\upp}
\noindent This sub-section defines the elements of the P* model:

\alnote{use pilot NOT pilot-job}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{\pilot \ (Pilot-Compute):} The pilot is the
  entity that actually gets submitted and scheduled on a resource
  using the resource's RM system. The PJ provides application (user)
  level control and management of the set of allocated resources.

  % and is responsible for the execution of \alwave{SUs/tasks}
  % onto the resource.

  % \alnote{\textbf{The RM assigns a slice of the Resource to the
  %     pilot -- that pilot then acts as RM for that resource slice.}
  %   I think simply equating a pilot with a RM is bit too
  %   simplistic. In a sense it is a application-level resource
  %   manger. Not sure what to do}

\item \textbf{\computeunit \ (\cu):} A \cu \ encapsulates a self-contained
  piece of work (a task) specified by the application that is
  submitted to the pilot-job framework.  There is no intrinsic notion
  of resource associated with a \cu.

\item \textbf{Scheduling Unit (SU):} SUs are the units of scheduling
  used internal to the P* model, i.e., an SU is not known by or
  visible to an application. An SU is created after the submission of
  a \cu, i.\,e.\ once a \cu \ has been passed into the control of the
  pilot-job framework.

\item \textbf{Pilot-Manager (PM):} The PM is responsible for (i)
  orchestrating the interaction between the pilots as well as the
  different components of the P* model (\cus, \sus) and (ii) decisions
  related to internal resource assignment (once resources have been
  acquired by the pilot-job).  For example, an SU can consists of one
  or more \cus. Further, \cus and \sus can be combined and aggregated;
  the PM determines how to group them, when \sus are scheduled and
  executed on a resource via the \pilot, as well as how many resources
  to assign to an SU.

% the different characteristics of the P* model. It
%   facilitates the coordination between the different P* elements,
%   i.\,e.\ the pilots, \cus and SUs. 
% A PM can e.\,g.\ manage solely one
%   or multiple pilots.

%   For example, the PM has the flexibility to combine and schedule \cus,
%   e.\,g.\ it can determine when a \cu is run and what as well as how
%   many resources it will receive.

\end{compactitem}

The application itself is not strictly part of the core P* Model. %  The
% term application generally refers to the upper layer of the stack.
An application kernel is the actual binary that gets executed.  The
application utilizes a PJ framework to execute multiple instances of
an application kernel (an ensemble) or alternatively instances of
multiple different application kernels (a workflow).  To execute an
application kernel, an application must define a \cu \ specifying the
application kernel as well as other parameters. This \cu \ is then
submitted to the pilot-manager (as an entry point to the
pilot-framework), where it transitions to an SU. The PM is then
responsible for scheduling the SU onto a pilot and then onto a
physical resource.  As we will see in \S{IV}, the above elements can
be mapped to specific entities in many pilot-jobs in existence and
use.

% \textbf{Diane Definition of Terms: } The computation consists of
% many worker processes which communicate with one master process (the
% worker processes do not need to share the filesystem nor
% memory). The ensemble of computation is called a run and it consists
% of many tasks which may be executed in parallel. A task is defined
% as a set of parameters which are produced by the RunMaster (running
% on a master node) and consumed by the WorkerAgent (running on a
% worker node).
% 
% from 
% 
% DIANE assumes the master-worker computing model (Fig.
% 1). Client sends job parameters to the Planner which partitions
% the job into smaller tasks executed by the Workers. Integrator
% is responsible for merging the results of task execution and
% sending the final job outcome to the Client.


\subsection{Characteristics of P* Model:\upp\upp}
\label{sec:p_star_elements}

%\jhanote{Why not have Binding as the first characteristics?}

% To understand % the degrees of freedom that any specific pilot-job
% % implementation must constraint as well as
% the functioning of

% The way the coordination between the different elements

We propose a set of fundamental properties/characteristics that
describe the interactions between the elements, and thus aid in the
description of P* model.

and the SUs, interact. A common coordination pattern is master/worker
(M/W): the PM represents the master process that controls a set of
worker processes, the pilots. The point of decision making is the
master process. In addition to the \emph{centralized} M/W, M/W can
also be deployed \emph{hierarchically}.  Alternatively, coordination
between the elements, in particular the pilots, can be performed so as
to be \emph{decentralized}, i.\,e.\ without central decision making
point.

%\input{sectionIII-comments}

\textbf{Communication:} The communication characteristics describes the
mechanisms for data exchange between the elements of the P* Model:
e.\,g.\ messages (point-to-point, all-to-all, one-to-all, all-to-one,
or group-to-group), streams (potentially unicast or multicast),
publish/subscribe messaging or shared data spaces.
		
\textbf{Scheduling:} The scheduling characteristics describes the
process of mapping a SU to resources via a pilot and potential
multiple levels of scheduling. Scheduling has a spatial component
(which SU is executed on which pilot?) but also a temporal component
(when to bind?). The different scheduling decisions that need to be
made are representative of multi-level scheduling decisions that are
often required in distributed environments.  For example, when should
a SU be bound to a pilot?  An SU can be bound to a pilot either before
the pilot has in turn been scheduled ({\it early} binding), whereas
{\it late} binding occurs if the SU is bound after the pilot has been
scheduled.  In general, there are multiple-levels at which scheduling
decisions, i.e., resource selection and binding, are made.

The term {\it agent}, although not a part of the P* Model, finds
mention when discussing implementations. For the purposes of this
paper, an agent refers to a ``proxy process'' that either inside the
pilot-job framework that has some decision making capability, and
could aid the implementation one or more of the characteristics of a
P* Model -- coordination, communication, scheduling, within a
pilot-job framework.  These agents can be used to enforce, a set of
(user-defined) policies (e.g.  resource capabilities, data/compute
affinities, etc.) and heuristics.



\subsection{Putting it all together} 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_pstar}
illustrates the interactions between the elements of the P* model. In
the first step the application specifies the capabilities of the
resources required using a pilot-job description (step 1). The PM then
submits the necessary number of pilots in order to fulfill the
resource requirements of the application (step~2). Each pilot is
queued at the resource manager, which is responsible for starting the
pilot (step~3). There can be variations of this flow: while in the
described model, the application defines the required resources, the
PM could also decide based on the submitted \cu \ workload whether and
when it submits new pilots.

The application can submit \cus to the PM at any time (step~4). A
submitted \cu \ becomes an SU, i.\,e.\ the PM is now in control of it. In
the simplest case one \cu \ corresponds to one SU; however, SUs can be
combined and aggregated to optimize throughputs and response
times. Commonly, a hierarchical M/W model is used internally: the PM
uses M/W to coordinate a set of pilots, the pilot itself functions as
manager for the execution of the assigned SUs.

In the first step the PM chooses the pilot on which an SU is executed
(step 5). Once a SU has been scheduled to a pilot, the pilot decides
when and on what physical resource the SU is scheduled. Further, the
pilot also manages the subsequent execution of the SU (step~6).  Again
there can be variations of this flow. PJ frameworks with decentralized
decision making often utilize autonomic agents that accepts
respectively pull SUs according to a set of defined policies.

% 
% Commonly, the pilot-manager (PM) can be accessed via a set of command

% the coordination of the SU execution. Again a pilot usually manages 1
% or more SUs using M/W. \jhanote{Need some clarification: what is the

% Scheduling decisions can be conducted on each level. The delegation of

% 
% \alnote{TODO: remove redundancy with paragraph above} As explained, a

\section{Pilot-Job Frameworks\upp\upp}

\note{OW says: we have this obsession with the term 'framework', but 
not everything is a framework, e.g., while BigJob and DIANE somewhat
resemble a framework, I do not see how Condor can qualify as one.\\
For now, I changed the title to 'systems'. If there are no objections,
I will make this consistent throughout the text}\alnote{I think we should keep 
frameworks, I do not see why Condor is not a framework -  we also would break 
consistency with our terms and definitions in section II.}\note{OW says:
"In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by user code, thus providing application specific software." This is 
definetely not the case for Condor and not really for BigJob. DIANE somewhat 
resembles a framework.}
\note{OW says: What if we call it Pilot-Job Implementations}

As more applications take advantage of dynamic execution, the
Pilot-Job concept has grown in popularity and has been extensively
researched and implemented for different usage scenarios and
infrastructure. There is a variety of PJ implementations:
Condor-G/Glide-in~\cite{condor-g}
, SWIFT~\cite{Wilde2011},
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910}, DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049},
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062041}, ToPoS~\cite{topos},
Nimrod/G~\cite{10.1109/HPC.2000.846563}, Falkon~\cite{1362680} and
MyCluster~\cite{1652061} to name a few. The aim of this section is to
show that our P* Model can be used to explain/understand some of these
PJ frameworks. In particular we focus on BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G/Glide-in.

\alnote{Is this a place to to describe ``native'' PJs for different 
infrastructures}

\jhanote{The aim of this section is to provide a conceptual validation
  of the P* model by describing/explaining the most commonly used
  PJ-frameworks and showing how the individual PJ-frameworks map to
  the P* model, i.e., can be explained by the P* model}


\upp
\subsection{Condor-G/Glide-in\upp\upp}

Condor-G pioneered the Pilot-Job concept~\cite{condor-g}. The pilot is
actually a complete Condor pool that is started using the Globus
service of a resource. This mechanism is referred to as Condor
Glide-In. Subsequently, jobs can be submitted to this Glide-In pool
using the standard Condor tools and APIs. Condor utilizes a
master/worker coordination model. The PJ manager is referred to as the
Condor Central Manager. The functionality of the Central Manager is
provided by several daemons: the condor\_master that is generally
responsible for managing all daemons on a machine, the
condor\_collector which collects resource information, the
condor\_negotiator that does the matchmaking and the condor\_schedd
that is responsible for managing the binding and scheduling
process. Condor generally does not differentiate between workload,
i.\,e.\ \cu, and schedulable entity, i.\,e.\ SU. Both entities are
referred to as job. However, it supports late binding, i.\,e.\
resources a job is submitted to must generally not be available at
submission time. The scheduler matches the capabilities required by a
\cu to the available resources. This process is referred to as
matchmaking. Further, a priority-based scheduler is used. For
communication between the identified elements Condor utilizes
point-to-point messaging using a binary protocol on top of TCP.

Different fault tolerance mechanisms, such as automatic retries, are
supported.  Further, Condor supports different security mechanisms:
for authentication it integrates both with local account management
systems (such as Kerberos) as well as grid authentication systems such
as GIS. Communication traffic can be encrypted.

\upp
\subsection{DIANE\upp\upp}

% Coordination and Communication
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} is a task coordination framework, which
was originally designed for implementing master/worker applications,
but also provides PJ functionality for job-style executions. DIANE
utilizes a single hierarchy of worker agents as well as a PJ manager
referred to as \texttt{RunMaster}.
%Further, there is ongoing work on a multi-master extension.
For the spawning of PJs a separate script, the so-called submitter script, is
required. For the access to the physical resources the GANGA
framework~\cite{Moscicki20092303} can be used.
%GANGA provides a
%unified interface for job submissions to various resource types, e.\,g.\ EGI
%resources or TG resources via a SAGA backend.
Once the worker agents are started they register themselves at the RunMaster.
In contrast to BigJob, a worker agent generally manages only a single
core and thus, by default is not able to run parallel applications (e.\,g.\
based on MPI). BJ utilizes the BJ-Agent that is able manage a set of local
resources (e.\,g.\ a certain number of nodes and cores) and thus, is capable
of running parallel applications. For communication between the RunMaster and
worker agents point-to-point messaging based on CORBA~\cite{OMG-CORBA303:2004}
is used. CORBA is also used for file staging, which is not fully supported by
BJ, yet.

% Binding 
DIANE is primarily designed with respect to HTC environments (such as
EGI~\cite{egi}), i.\,e.\ one PJ consists of a single worker agent with the
size of 1 core. BJ in contrast is designed for HPC systems such as TG,
where a job usually allocates multiple nodes and cores. To address this issue
a so-called multinode submitter script can be used: the scripts starts a
defined number of worker agents on a certain resource. However, \cus will be
constrained to the specific number of cores managed by a worker agent. A
flexible allocation of resource chunks as with BJ is not possible. By
default a \cu  is mapped to a SU; application can however implement smarter
allocation schemes, e.\,g.\ the clustering of multiple \cus into a SU.

%Scheduling
DIANE includes a simple capability matcher and FIFO-based task scheduler.
Plugins for other workloads, e.\,g.\ DAGs or for data-intensive
application, exist or are under development. The framework is extensible:
applications can implement a custom application-level scheduler.


%Other impl. related issues: FT and security
DIANE is as BJ a single-user PJ, i.\,e.\ each PJ is executed with the
privileges of the respective user. Also, only \cus of this respective user can be
executed by DIANE. DIANE supports various middleware security mechanisms
(e.\,g.\ GSI, X509 authentication). For this purpose it relies on GANGA. The
implementation of GSI on TCP-level is possible, but currently not yet
implemented. Further, DIANE supports fault tolerance: basic error detection and
propagation mechanisms are in place. Further, an automatic re-execution of \cus
is possible.

    % 	\end{figure}


% General overview of BJ implementations & P* model
%PJ implementations in TROY are called BigJob (BJ)~\cite{bigjob_web}.
BigJob (BJ)~\cite{bigjob_web,saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} is a SAGA-based pilot-job
implementation. BJ supports a wide range of application types, and is usable
over a broad range of infrastructures, i.\,e.\ it is general-purpose and
extensible. In addition, there are specific BJ flavors for cloud resources such
as Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure that are capable of managing set of VMs, as
well as a BJ with a Condor-G/Glide-in based backend. \alnote{these flavors are primarily 
defined by the SAGA adaptor mechanism.}

          framework, the BigJob-Manager orchestrates a set of
          pilots. Pilots are started using the SAGA Job API. The
          application submits CUs, the so-called sub-jobs via the
          BigJob-Manager. Communication between the BJ-Manager and
          BJ-Agent is done via a shared data space, the Advert
          Service. The BJ-Agent is responsible for managing and
          monitoring sub-jobs.}
		\alnote{Make connection to P*}
	\label{fig:figures_re_bigjob_interactions}
	\upp\upp \upp
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:figures_re_bigjob_interactions} illustrates the architecture of
BJ. BJ utilizes a M/W coordination model: The BigJob-Manager is responsible for
the orchestration of pilots, for the binding of \cus \note{OW says: binding to what?}
and for the scheduling of
SUs. For submission of the pilots, BigJob relies on the SAGA Job API, and thus can
be used in conjunction with different SAGA adaptors, e.\,g.\ the Globus, the
PBS, the Condor(-G) and the Amazon Web Service adaptor. 
\note{OW says: Better: relies on the job submission capabilites of SAGA, which include
Globus, PBS, Condor, ...}
Each pilot initializes a so
called BJ-agent. The agent is responsible for gathering local information
and for executing tasks (SUs) on its local resource. The SAGA Advert Service
is used for communication between manager and agent. The Advert Service (AS)
exposes a shared data space that can be accessed by manager and agent, which use
the AS to realize a push/pull communication pattern, i.\,e.\ the manager pushes
a SU to the AS while the agents periodically pull for new SUs. Results and state
updates are similarly pushed back from the agent to the manager. Further, BJ
provides a pluggable communication \& coordination layer and also supports
alternative c\&c systems, e.\,g.\ Redis~\cite{redis} and ZeroMQ~\cite{zmq}.

BJ currently uses a simple binding mechanism: each \cu  submitted to the BigJob
framework is mapped to one SU. Binding can take places at submission
time (early binding) or delayed in case of multiple pilots (late binding). 
For scheduling, a simple FIFO scheduler is used (see also
table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison}).


% All core BJ are confined to a single resource and don't allow
% neither elasticity nor late binding.

%paragraph on dynamic capabilities

In many scenarios it is beneficial to utilize multiple resources, e.\,g.\ to
accelerate the time-to-completion or to provide resilience to resource failures
and/or unexpected delays. The Pilot-API allows for dynamic resource
additions/removals as well as late binding. The support of this feature depends
on the backend used. To support this feature on top of various BigJob
implementations that are by default restricted to single resource use (e.\,g.\
BJ), the concept of a BigJob pool is introduced. A BigJob pool consists of
multiple BJs (each BigJob managing one particular resource). An extensible
scheduler is used for dispatching \cus to one of the BJs of the pool (late
binding). By default a FIFO scheduler is provided. Other backends (such as DIANE
and Condor) natively support elasticity, but can nevertheless be combined into a
BJ pool.

% \note{OW says: Where is that magic BigJob-Pool and its scheduler? Is there an
% API for that? That's also part of the capabilities provided by
% bigjob-server.}\alnote{The BigJob pool is formerly known as ManyJob. In the
% bigjob/examples directory, there are multiple examples (e.g.
% example\_manyjob\_local.py) that show how multiple BJ can be used concurrently.}

\subsection{SWIFT-Coaster\upp\upp}

SWIFT~\cite{Wilde2011} is a scripting language designed for expressing
abstract workflows and computations. The language provides among many
things capabilities for executing external application as well as the
implicit management of data flows between application tasks. For this
purpose, SWIFT formalizes the way that applications can define
data-dependencies. Using so called mappers, these dependencies can be
easily extended to files or groups of files. The runtime environment
handles the allocation of resources and the spawning of the compute
tasks. Both data- and execution management capabilities are provided
via abstract interfaces. SWIFT supports e.\,g.\ Globus, Condor and PBS
resources.  The pool of resources that is used for an application is
statically defined in a configuration file. While this configuration
file can refer to highly dynamic resources (such as OSG resources),
there is no possibility to manage this resource pool
programmatically. By default a 1:1 mapping for \cu and jobs is
used. However, SWIFT supports the grouping SUs as well as PJs. For the
PJ functionality the Coaster~\cite{coasters} framework is
used. Coaster relies on a master/worker coordination model;
communication is implemented using GSI-secured TCP sockets. SWIFT and
Coaster supports various scheduling mechanisms, e.\,g.\ a FIFO and a
load-aware scheduler.

Further, SWIFT can be used in conjunction with Falkon~\cite{1362680}. Falkon
refers to pilots as the so called provisioner, which are created using the
Globus GRAM service. The provisioner spawns a set of executor processes on the
allocated resources, which are then responsible for managing the execution of
SUs. \cus are submitted via a so called dispatcher service. Similar to Coaster,
Falkon utilizes a M/W coordination model, i.\,e.\ the executors periodically
query the dispatcher for new SUs. Web services are used for communication.


\subsection{Discussion}



P* provides a theoretical framework for describing and understanding of PJ
implementations. Table~\ref{table:bigjob-saga-diane} summarizes how P* can be applied
to BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G/Glide-in. Further, we show that P* is not limited to the
described PJ frameworks, but can also be used with other PJ frameworks, e.\,g.\
SWIFT Coasters~\cite{coasters}. The same applies to the P* characteristics 
that
are summarized in table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison}. In addition to
applying the theoretical P* framework, we exposed BigJob, DIANE and Condor
through the Pilot-API, i.\,e.\ the Pilot-API can now be used as unified 
abstraction across multiple PJ frameworks 
(see figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}).
This validates (i) the P* abstractions and (ii) the extensibility of the P* 
model. \msnote{Hmm, this needs attention after TROY removal}


% \note{TROY provides a
%   unified API that can be used to expose various PJ frameworks
%   (e.\,g.\ BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G). Further, it enables the
%   concurrent usage of multiple PJ frameworks (see

%   approach to TROY's API design --- its SAGA inspired adaptor-based
%   architecture, leverage the design experiences of SAGA, are appealing
%   to the pilot-job user community. Also, the chosen designs enables
%   the easy exchange of PJ implementations and the concurrent use of
%   multiple PJ frameworks. TROY thus functions as common access layer
%   for different PJ frameworks, providing interoperability and

%API~\cite{troy_api}, a runtime system and a set of adaptors for
%various PJ frameworks (see figure~\ref{fig:figures_pstar_troy}). 
% \note{OW says: Technically, an API can't have a runtime system.  An
%   API is an interface definition and doesn't contain any
%   implementation aspects.  IMHO a more accurate description would be:
%   "TROY is a bridging library that can interface with existing pilot
%   job systems. It exposes its functionality through an API that
%   resembles (exposes the components of) the P* model."} \jhanote{Ole
%   can you comment be removed now?}


\jhanote{Somewhere we need to define the different approaches to
  interoperability. One is via the interface/API; the other is via
  deeper integration. In the former the lowest common denominator
  approach is employed. In the latter semantic differences are
  addressed but at different levels. Andre M: Would this be a good
  place to introduce ``leaky abstractions''?}  \alnote{elaborate on

The Pilot-API and is thus in spirit similar to the SAGA
API~\cite{saga_url,ogf-gfd-90}.

\jhanote{Please elaborate the following} It is also consistent with
SAGA in that it can support the same underlying job-model...
\jhanote{ not sure about the relevance of the following sentence:} The
Pilot-API itself was designed to be similar to SAGA in appearance and
philosophy: it re-uses many of the well defined and standardized
semantics and syntax.

\jhanote{place..} SAGA provides a simple, POSIX-style API to the most
common grid functions at a sufficiently high-level of abstraction so
as to be independent of the diverse and dynamic grid environments.

A further design consideration of the Pilot-API was a minimal but
complete API.

\note{OW says: Minimal and complete is implicit, since the TROY API
resembles P*, which claims to be minimal and complete. I think it would 
be more important to discuss *why* we expose the P* model components one to one
on API level and not, e.g., provide a higher level of abstraction.
This should be discussed along with the scope of TROY and its
target 'audience' -- this is currently missing in the paper.}

% MS: commented out the next session as it talks about the runtime system
% The pilot-job capabilities in TROY are provided by different PJ
% frameworks that are integrated into the TROY runtime system via
% adaptors. For this purpose, TROY defines a Capability Provider
% Interface (CPI) that must be implemented by the adaptors of the
% underlying pilot-job frameworks. This architecture also enables the

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_troy_flow} shows the interactions between the
P* elements. The Pilot-API decouples workload management and resource
scheduling by exposing two separate services: The
\texttt{PilotJobService} (PJS) and \texttt{WorkUnitService} (WUS). The
PJS serves as a factory for instantiating pilots. Also, the PJS can be
used to query the PJS for currently active pilots.  A
\texttt{PilotJob} object is returned as result of the
\texttt{create\_pilotjob()} method of the PJS (step 1).

As in SAGA, the instantiation of \texttt{PilotJob} object is done by
using a \texttt{PilotJobDescription}. The description can be reused
and has no state, while the \texttt{PilotJob} instance has state and
is a reference for further usage. \jhanote{Following sentence needs
  attention as it is incorrect I think} The actual creation of the PJ
is done via the adaptor, which is responsible for calling the
underlying PJ framework (step 2 and 3).

The \texttt{PilotJob} object represents a pilot instance and allows the 
application to interact with a pilot, e.\,g.\ to query its state or to cancel 
it. The process of PJ creation is depicted in step 1-3 of 
figure~\ref{fig:figures_troy_flow} and in listing~\ref{lst:pjs_creation}.

Listing~\ref{lst:wus_creation} shows the creation of a \texttt{WorkUnitService}.
Having instantiated a \texttt{WorkUnitService} object, PJS objects can be added
and removed at any time. This enables applications to respond to dynamic
resource requirements at runtime, i.\,e.\ if peak demands arise an application
can request additional resources; if resources are not required anymore, they
can be released.

The \texttt{WorkUnitService} is responsible for managing the execution of \cus.
Regardless of the state of the PJS, applications can submit \cus to a
\texttt{WorkUnitService} at anytime (listing~\ref{lst:submission} and step 4 in
figure~\ref{fig:figures_troy_flow}). Once the \texttt{WorkUnitService} becomes
responsible for a \cu, the \cu  transitions to an SU. SUs are internally processed
(they e.\,g.\ can be aggregated) and are then forwarded to the
\texttt{Scheduler} (step 5), which selects an appropriate pilot. Having chosen
an appropriate resource, the SU is dispatched using the respective adaptor (step
6 and 7). The PJ framework is responsible for the actual execution of the SU on
a resource
\note{OW says: Somewhat inconsistent. The 'framework' is earlier described as 
the 'whole' thing. Isn't the 'adaptor' responsible for execution?}. 
Note that multiple levels of (hierarchical) scheduling can be
present, commonly a SU is scheduled inside a PJ framework and the model allows
it to be present in multiple layers.






% In figure~\ref{fig:figures_troy_flow} the flow of a simple execution scenario is
% displayed. The Pilot Job Service and the Work Unit Service are already
% instantiated. The application requests the Pilot Job Service to create a new
% pilot-job (step 1), the Pilot Job Service will pass the request on to the
% relevant adaptor (step 2), which will eventually launch the pilot-job on a
% resource using a pilot-job framework (step 3). At this stage there might be a
% pilot-job already available, or the request can still reside in a queue
% somewhere. Regardless of the state of the pilot-job, the application can submit
% a work unit to the Work Unit Service (step 4). The Work Unit Service remains
% responsible for keeping track of the Work Unit during its lifetime. Based on the
% heuristics or policies the WUS decides on a potential aggregation of SUs. The SU 
% is then forwarded to the Scheduler (step 5). The Scheduler will schedule SUs to 
% an appropriate adaptor that represents a capable resource (step 6). Finally, the
% adaptor will submit the SU to the PJ framework which will
% take care of the actual execution on a resource. Note that multiple levels of 
% (hierarchical) scheduling can be present. Inside
% TROY there is already scheduling taking place inside the Work Unit Service. 
% Additionally, the underlying PJ framework can conduct its own scheduling.


Each \texttt{WorkUnit} and the \texttt{PilotJob} object is associated with a
state. The state model is based on the SAGA job state
model~\cite{ogf-gfd-90}.
\note{OW says: Why? IMHO the GFD.90 state model has some serious flaws, like
the absence of a 'Waiting' state.} 
Applications can query the state using the \texttt{get\_state()} method or they
can subscribe to state update notifications.

The Pilot-API classes and interactions are designed to reflect the P*

\note{OW says: Why? See earlier note about the scope of TROY}
Table~\ref{table:pstar_elements}
summarizes the mapping of P* elements and the Pilot-API. As defined by P*, a \cu 
represents a primary self-containing piece of work that is submitted
through the Pilot-API. At the API boundary a \cu  transitions to an SU, which
functions as internal unit of scheduling.
\note{OW says: Does this really happen at the API boundary? Earlier, 
the text says: 'Once the WUS becomes responsible for a CU, the CU
transitions to a SU. This suggests that a CU lives beyond 'API level'.}
The API follows
object-oriented design principles and exposes the primary
functionality of the Pilot-Manager using two classes: the
\texttt{PilotJobService} for the management of pilots and the
\texttt{WorkUnitService} for the management of \cus. Further, the
framework utilizes a set of internal classes for implementing
different P* characteristics, e.\,g.\ the \texttt{Scheduler} for
scheduling and the adaptors implementations for providing the actual
PJ capabilities.

% MS: This is runtime system  text again
% TROY uses the M/W coordination model: The TROY runtime system
% functions as master for a set of PJ frameworks that are encapsulated

% \note{OW says: Maybe explain this: The TROY scheduler pushes SUs

% Inside the PJ framework itself another

In this section we analyze the performance and scalability of
different PJ frameworks on production infrastructures.  Further, we
investigate PJ framework interoperability by using multiple PJ
frameworks concurrently using the Pilot-API.  

For purposes of validation, demonstration and performance
measurements, we use the Pilot-API to marshall different PJ
frameworks...\jhanote{Need a simple description of experiment
  configuration}.  The experiments are conducted on different
production (XSEDE, EGI, OSG, LONI(?)) and research infrastructures
(FutureGrid).

It should also be noted that our experiments do not try to identify
the ``best'' or ``fastest'' PJ framework, as that is very dependent on
the exact use case and infrastructure -- instead, we try to
demonstrate that the investigated PJ frameworks are ultimately very
similar in architecture and semantics, are performing roughly similar
(or at least comparably) for the chosen workload, and can indeed
sensibly be used in concertation.  \amnote{Someone please check the

\subsection{Understanding Coordination in PJ Frameworks\upp\upp}
\label{sec:pj_performance}
\alnote{title?}
\alnote{Explain why /bin/date!}

Each PJ implementation is associated with various degrees of freedom,
in particular in the design of the communication \& coordination
(c\&c) sub-system.  The primary barrier for performance and
scalability is not the \cu  submission, but the internal coordination of
the elements of a P* implementation. There are many factors that
influence the overall performance, e.\,g.\ the degree of distribution
(local (LAN) vs. remote (WAN)), the communication pattern (1:n versus
n:n) and the communication frequency. In the following we investigate
the impact of different c\&c related factors on the overall
performance and scalability of the system.

The original design of BigJob is based on a shared, centralized data
space, the SAGA Advert Service~\cite{saga_advert}, which is
essentially a PostgreSQL database. The communication between all
components is done via this data space; this concept is also known as
tuple space~\cite{Gelernter:1985:GCL:2363.2433}.  The data space
decouples BJ-Manager and BJ-Agent very well and allows both entities
to operate at their own pace optimizing the overall throughput.
Depending on the setup this data space can be deployed locally,
i.\,e.\ on the same resource, or remotely, e.\,g.\ during a
distributed run. A particular issue during distributed runs is the
latency between the application and the Advert Service. Another
challenge is that this design introduces a potential
single-point-of-failure and scalability bottleneck if the centralized
data space is not carefully designed and operated.


BigJob also provides two alternative c\&c sub-systems:
Redis~\cite{redis} and ZeroMQ~\cite{zmq}. Redis is a lightweight
key/value store, which can be deployed in a distributed, fault
tolerant way. Redis is used in a similar way as the Advert database,
i.\,e.\ all communication between BJ-Agent and manager is channeled
through it. Redis can be deployed locally and remotely.  The ZeroMQ
c\&c sub-system in contrast utilizes a client-server architecture,
which is similar to the CORBA-based~\cite{OMG-CORBA303:2004}
communication system of DIANE. In this architecture, the PM maintains
the overall state. Clients connect to the PM to request new SUs or to
report state updates. An advantage of this architecture is that it
does not require a separate infrastructure for deployment of the
Advert Service or the Redis database. While the BJ-Manager can be
deployed remotely from the BJ-Agent, in most cases this will not be
the case, i.\,e.\ the communication between BJ-Manager and BJ-Agent is
mostly local communication. Both the data space and client-server c\&c
sub-system can be combined with a publish/subscribe mechanisms,
i.\,e.\ instead of polling an agent or client can receive
notifications when a new SU arrives. 

We evaluate different BJ configurations and compare and contrast them
with DIANE. For this purpose, we conducted several experiments on
FutureGrid~\cite{fg}. To evaluate the overall performance and
throughput, we execute a different number of \cus on Alamo and Sierra
utilizing up to 128 cores concurrently. Each experiment is repeated at
least 10 times.

% \jhanote{Need to motivate testing of c\&c sub-system better: There are
%   many barriers to interoperability and performance. primary barrier to
%   performance is not \cu  submission or SU scheduling to PM, but the
%   fundamental limitation of scalability of coordination -- with
%   increasing number of \cu /SU.  Establish tradeoff between distributed
%   vs local coordination. e.g., It is easy to get consistency but has
%   overhead.  Easy to get performance but difficult to get
%   consistency. Thus we opt for centralized / persistent point. But how
%   does this single point-of-coordination behave with increasing number
%   of connections? } \alnote{hopefully addressed most points in paragraph above}

\label{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-wus} \end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-wus} illustrate the performance and
scalability of the different BigJob configurations and DIANE with respect to the
number of \cus. Clearly, the used c\&c sub-system has a great impact on the
overall performance. The Redis backend shows the best performance for small \cu 
counts. The difference between local and remote coordination is moderate (about
20\,\%). While ZeroMQ is very fast and lightweight, it requires a careful
implementation in particular concerning synchronization and throughput
optimization. The overall performance is slightly worse than for Redis. The
Advert Service currently has some limitations which will be discussed later.
DIANE shows a higher startup overhead, which is particularly observable for
smaller \cu  numbers. However, the runtime increases only slightly (about 10\,sec)
when going from 64 to 2048 \cus. A reason for this behavior is that DIANE
aggregates SUs: for 2048 \cus only a single task description is created, which
the framework then efficiently distribute to its worker agents. BigJob in
contrast maintains for each \cu  a separate description. 
% At the investigated
% scales, the single manager does not represent a bottleneck with respect to the
% processable \cu  numbers. Further, the TROY manager introduces another 
% hierarchy-level which can further
% enhance the overall scalability.

Figure~\ref{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-cores} illustrates the performance
scalability with respect to the number of cores. In particular, the Redis
(Local) configuration show an almost linear scalability up to 128 cores. The
Redis remote setup again imposed some overhead (about 14\,\%). ZeroMQ performs
very well with lower core counts; with larger core counts the runtimes increase
indicating a potential scalability bottleneck. DIANE shows in particular for
lower core counts a longer runtime again due to the higher startup overhead.
With higher core counts DIANE behaves similar to BigJob ZeroMQ showing a greater
increase of the overall runtime. This increase can likely be attributed to
the single central manager in the client-server architecture. As in the last
experiment, the Advert c\&c sub-system showed a significantly lower performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering

an almost linear scalability achieving a throughput of up to 4 \cus/sec. }
\label{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-cores} 
\upp\upp
\end{figure}

The BigJob Advert implementation currently shows some performance
limitations mainly caused by the prototypical nature of the Advert
Service implementation.  Further, it must be noted that the Advert
Service was deployed remotely (mainly due to deployment
constraints). However, even considering this aspect the discrepancy
between Advert Service and Redis (Remote), which has been deployed on
the same remote network, is significant. A reason for the worse
performance is the used remote access protocol. The Advert Service is
based on PostgreSQL; in the current architecture the client, i.\,e.\
the BJ-Manager and agent access the PostgreSQL database via the SOCI
backend library. While this architecture provides a very flexible
remote access to the database, running database access protocol over a
WAN connection is not optimal. % \jhanote{It is not clear why REDIS and
%   ZeroMQ are not susceptible to access over WAN
%   delays/latency?}\alnote{included a comparison note to Redis
%   Remote. We can't compare it to ZMQ since we use only local
%   communication in this case}
Transactions e.\,g.\ are very latency
sensitive and require several roundtrips.  Further, the API is based
on a hierarchical namespace, which does not naturally map well to
relational databases. In particular deeply nested namespaces exhibit
an insufficient query and update performance. In contrast, both in the
Redis and ZeroMQ scenario, data is stored in memory, which also
explains to significant performance gains.

\subsection{Characterizing PJ Frameworks on Production Infrastructure\upp\upp}

To validate the abstractions developed, we conducted a series of experiments.
We execute BFAST~\cite{bfast2009} -- a genome sequencing application -- using
the Pilot-API in conjunction with different PJ frameworks and infrastructures.
For this purpose we use the Pilot-API with various BigJob configurations and
DIANE. BigJob is used with the SAGA-Torque adaptor to access XSEDE~\cite{}
resources and with the PBS/SSH plugin to access FutureGrid~\cite{} machines.
SAGA-Condor adaptor to access OSG resources~\cite{1742-6596-78-1-012057}.
Further, we utilize DIANE on EGI. \msnote{more on EGI later ...} On the XSEDE, 
Kraken is used with up to 512 cores concurrently. 

\note{On OSG ...}

%\note{OW says: That would be the case if we use Condor-G. The machines
%is belhaven-1.renci.org - a Globus/PBS cluster that accepts Condor jobs.\\
%So the OSG is a peculiar beast. My current understanding is, that it consits 
%of a bunch of HPC clusters with a Globus frontend. OSG uses an automated 
%Glide-in WMS service that starts glide-ins via Condor-G on these clusters.
%The glide-ins are aggregated and presented to the OSG (HTC) user as a 
%standard condor pool for HTC jobs. While using OSG through condor seems 
%to be a popular mode of operation, it is possible to access any of the 
%OSG-member clusters via Condor-G and through Globus directly. As far as I
%understand, this is the preferred mode for running HPC (multi-core) 
%applications.\\
%This raises two important questions: does it make sense it all to use
%BigJob with the OSG condor pool? We would end up with one BJ agent per
%condor job which represents one core, which would just add a lot of overhead and
%no benefits. Using OSG via Condor-G or even Globus would allow us to
%take advantage of larger reservations, e.g. one BJ agent that manages
%128 cores.\\
%While it would make sense for TROY to implement a native Condor 'backend'
%that doesn't use another layer of 'agents' and master/worker advert

%what we want to show, I propose that we use BigJob with Globus (we now that 
%it works) on OSG. While this doesn't show pilot job interoperabiltiy
%(which his hard to achieve without TROY anyways), it still shows cross-grid
%interoperability.}


% To manage the genome sequencing workflow we use
% theDARE~\cite{dare-tg11-gateways} framework that has been built on
% top of TROY.

The investigated workload comprises of 128 \cus. Each \cu executes a BFAST
matching process, which is used to find potential sequence alignments. We run
the experiment on four different setups: (i) BigJob/XSEDE only, (ii) 
BigJob/FutureGrid, (iii) BigJob/OSG only, (iv) DIANE/EGI only.
The Pilot Job Service is used to create pilots on the respective
infrastructure(s). Each BFAST \cu requires 1 core; In each case 128 \cus
are defined and submitted to the Compute Unit Service. Depending on the 
resource, a different number of cores can be reserved to each BFAST \cu, 
e.\,g.\ on Kraken 4 cores are reserved for each \cu. Each \cu is associated 
with a set of input files which is pre-staged in case (i) and (ii). For the 
HTC infrastructures: EGI and OSG (case (iii) and (iv)), these file are 
transferred before running each \cu. \alnote{Are the files staged once for 
each \cu?} Having submitted the 128\,\cus, the benchmark application can 
monitor the state using the Compute Unit Service of the Pilot-API.

	\label{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj} shows the results of the experiments. In
addition to the runtime we measured the queuing time, i.\,e.\ the time
required until the first \cu changes its state to running. The overhead is
defined as the difference between the actual runtime of the BFAST \cu and the
overall runtime using the Pilot-API (not including the queuing time).

The runtime for DIANE is about 70\,sec longer than for BigJob. The main
contributor for this increased runtime is the deployment time required for
DIANE. In a multi-node setup multiple work agents must be used (4 in this
case). For each worker agent DIANE must be downloaded, installed and started
separately. Further, in the used DIANE setup, the executable is staged. This
is particularly different from the scenario investigated in
section~\ref{sec:pj_performance}, in which no file staging is used. In total
the setup of DIANE requires about 110\,sec of the overall 240\,sec runtime,
i.\,e.\ about 45\,\%. Further, each DIANE worker agent is queued as a separate
job at the local resource manager -- this contributes to the higher deviation
in the measured runtimes. Despite the fact that BigJob has been also installed
with each run, it shows a significant lower startup time of 73\,sec, i.\,e.\
about 50\,sec less than DIANE. Additionally, we also observed a runtime
overhead of about 25\,sec for the DIANE scenario. This overhead is likely
caused by the additional agents required. While BigJob utilizes one BJ-Agent
on the resource, DIANE currently requires the spawning of one worker agent per
\cu that must be executed in parallel. While the Pilot-API marshals these
differences, i.\,e.\ while the API remains the same for both PJ frameworks, a
light performance overhead remains observable.

The run with BigJob Condor shows the best performance of all scenarios. This
can mainly be attributed to the better performance of the OSG resource, which is
particularly visible in the BFAST runtimes, which are on average 40\,\% shorter
than on LONI. Further, due to the lack of SAGA on OSG, BJ is deployed with the
Redis c\&c sub-system, which shows a significantly better performance than the
Advert Service (see section~\ref{sec:pj_performance}).

% \jhanote{What are we trying to say here?  Is it that although the API
%   is similar, semantics of implementation and execution remain
%   different, and that TROY backend handles them?}\alnote{well said}

Finally scenario (iv) demonstrates that two PJ frameworks can be
utilized concurrently using the Pilot-API. The
performance in this scenario is slightly better than in the DIANE only
case, mainly due to the fact that only four DIANE worker agents need
to be started. Also, only half of the \cus are executed on a DIANE node
and thus, show a longer runtime. While there are some limitations in
the current DIANE implementation, the aim of this experiment is
to emphasizes the possibilities that the Pilot-API provides to dynamic
applications. The Pilot-API enables applications to utilize a dynamic resource
pool consisting of resources of different infrastructures, e.\,g.\ EGI
and TG/XD resources, at large-scales hitherto unattainable. 
% This part also sounds too engine-like
% Dynamic
% applications can utilize the elasticity of the TROY resource pool
% e.\,g.\ to improve the time-to-completion and/or to scale the accuracy

\subsection{Understanding PJ Framework Interoperability\upp\upp}

We define two kinds of interoperability: (i) SAGA-based interoperability, 
i.\,e.\ the usage of BJ in conjunction with different SAGA adaptors and 
infrastructures and (ii) PJ framework interoperability, i.\,e.\ the usage of 
different PJ frameworks via the Pilot-API. For scenario (i) we run BigJob 
concurrently on FutureGrid and XSEDE and for scenario (ii) we concurrently run 
BigJob and DIANE on FutureGrid and EGI.

\section{P* as a Model for Pilot-Data\upp\upp}
\label{sec:pilot-data}
\alnote{remove emphasis on dynamic execution}
Dynamic execution is at least equally important for data-intensive
applications: applications must cope with various challenging issues
e.\,g.\ varying data sources (such as sensors and/or other application
components), fluctuating data rates, optimizations for different
queries, data-/compute co-location etc. Thus, having defined the P*
model, we explore its extension to data.
%so as to facilitate an understanding of dynamic execution. 
This will motivate an analogous abstraction that we call
\emph{\pilotdata (PD)}. \jwave{PD provides late-binding capabilities
  for data by separating the allocation of physical storage and
  application-level data units.}  Further, it provides an abstraction
for expressing and managing relationships between data units and/or
work units. These relationships are referred to as
\emph{affinities}.  %

% \jhanote{difficult to use affinity without defining it..}
% \alnote{tried to describe affinities a little bit better}

%\alnote{Extension vs. Application vs. Translation}
\subsubsection*{P* Model Elements for Data}

% A Pilot-Data Framework facilitates the late-binding between data units
% and physical storage resources, the so called pilot-stores.

The elements defined by P* (in section~\ref{sec:p_star_elements}) can
be extended by the following elements:

%\alnote{What is the role of SU in Data?}
\begin{compactenum}[A.]

\item \textbf{\pilot (Pilot-Data):} A \pilotdata (\pd) functions as a 
	placeholder object that reserves the space
	for data units. PD facilitates the late-binding of data and resource and is
	equivalent to the \pilot in the compute model.

\item \textbf{Data Unit (DU):} DU is the base unit of data assigned by
  the application,  e.\,g.\ a data file or chunk. Multiple DUs can be aggregated 
   within a Data Unit Set.

% \item \textbf{Pilot-Data (PD):} PD allows the logical grouping of DUs
%   and the expression of data-data affinities. This collection of files
%   can be associated with an extensible set of properties. One of these
%   properties is affinity. 

\item \textbf{Scheduling Unit (SU):} is an internal unit of scheduling (as in 
the compute model). The Pilot framework can can aggregate or split DUs into one 
or more SUs.

\item The \textbf{Pilot-Manager (PM)} is the same as in the compute model and
implements the different characteristics of the P* model. It is responsible for
managing \dus and \sus. Data is submitted to the framework via the PM. The PM
which is responsible for mapping \dus to \sus and for conducting decision 
regarding resource assignments. \sus are placed on physical resources via the \pilot.
	
\end{compactenum}
 
Note, each element can be mapped to an element in the P* Model by
symmetry, e.\,g., a DU correspond to a \cu  in the original P* Model; 
a PD is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of storage on a physical 
resource and corresponds to the \pilot in the P* Model.

% \jhanote{PJ Model is confusing. Either it is P Model or PJ
%   Framework} \alnote{ok}

% A particular critical requirement for data-intensive application, is
% the management of affinity between DUs and also between \cus and
% DUs. Thus, Pilot-Data introduces the PD container object for
% expressing relationships between DUs. A PD corresponds to an SU in
% the \jwave{PJ model}, i.\,e.\ it is used as scheduling unit for
% internal optimizations, e.\,g.\ the grouping of DUs. Having
% instantiated a PD, it can be assigned to a PS via the PD manager. A
% PS is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of storage, i.\,e.\
% it corresponds to a pilot in the pilot-job model. By associating a
% PD to a PS the data is actually moved to the physical location
% associated with the PS. The PD manager facilitates the creation of
% PSs, schedules data movements (with respect to specified affinities)
% and manages data accesses.

\subsubsection*{P* Model Characteristics for Data}

While the extended P* Model introduces new elements, the
characteristics however, remain the same to a great extent. The
coordination characteristic describes how the elements of PD interact,
e.\,g.\ utilizing the M/W model; the communication characteristic can
be applied similarly. The scheduling characteristics must be extended
to not only meet compute requirements, but also to support common data
access patterns. The scheduling component particularly needs to
consider affinities, i.\,e.\ user-defined relationships between \cus
and/or \dus. Data-data affinities e.\,g.\ exist if different \dus must
be present at the same compute element; data-compute affinities arise
if data and compute must be co-located for a computation, but their
current location is different. Data and compute placement decisions are
made by the scheduler based on defined policies, affinities \& dynamic
resource information.


\subsubsection*{Pilot-API for Data}

Analogous to the Pilot API for Compute, the Data API defines the
\texttt{PilotDataService} entity as an abstraction for creating and managing
pools of storage. A \texttt{PilotStore} represents the actual physical storage
space. The \texttt{ComputeDataService} entity functions as an application-level
scheduler, which accepts both \texttt{ComputeUnits} and \texttt{DataUnits}. It
resolves necessary dependencies (e.g. data/data or data/computer affinities),
and is responsible for managing the execution of the Data and Compute Units.



% \input{bigdata}
% 
% Both BigJob and BigData define similar elements that can be mapped to
% each other. Nevertheless, compute and data model sometimes require a
% different treatment.  The extended TROY (an implementation of the
% extended P* Model) will optimize data- and computing according to a
% set of defined affinities and policies.

% BJ and BD encapsulate cross-cutting properties across data and
% computation. 

% With the maturing of both models and
% implementations, we expect that both the PJ and PD model converge in
% the future.

\section{Discussion and Future Work \upp\upp}
\label{sec:discussion-future-work}
% The P* model was used to demonstrate

% We established PJ and PD as abstractions for supporting dynamic
% execution by decoupling workload and resource
% assignment/scheduling. 

% they share different important properties with respect to the commonly
% used communication and coordination schemes.

\alnote{Add discussion on limitations of API - address these limitations in a 
common runtime system.}

The primary intellectual contribution of this work has been the
development of the P* Model, its validation via the Pilot-API and the mapping
of P* elements to PJ frameworks such as DIANE and Condor-G. 
 
The P* Model provides a common framework for describing and
characterizing Pilot-abstractions. The Pilot-API 
captures the commonalities between the different PJ
frameworks and provides a common access to them via a consistent API.
We validate the P* Model by demonstrating that the most widely used PJ
frameworks, viz., DIANE and Condor-G can be compared, contrasted and
analyzed using this analytical
framework.% , i.\,e.\ the architecture and the
% communication and coordination schemes.\alnote{i.e. sub-clause can go}

Building on the P* Model, the Pilot-API's design enables the easy exchange of
PJ implementations, and also the concurrent use of
multiple PJ frameworks. The Pilot-API functions as common access layer for
different PJ frameworks, thus providing interoperability and
extensibility.

There is potential for immense practical implications of our work, as
these PJ frameworks collectively support millions of tasks yearly;
however as alluded, these frameworks were not engineered with
interoperability and extensibility as first-class considerations, and
are thus faced with real barriers to scalability.  Our work has the
potential to ameliorate this situation.

\msnote{Need to introduce TROY now}
The TROY framework will be
extended to support advanced autonomic resource management and
selection strategies, e.\,g.\ by deploying more decentral decision
logic into the agents, thus providing possible further improvements to
scalability

% Having established the validity of the P* Model and TROY, in the
% future, 
%\alnote{this paragraph can IMHO be merged with the last paragraph}


Furthermore, our experience with fragile grid middleware and infrastructures
has taught us to appreciate the significance of details that come into play
while deploying software on heterogeneous distributed infrastructures, and which
in spite of theoretical and architectural advances have the potential to limit
impact. However, the SAGA inspired approach to the Pilot-API design and the
leverage of the design and deployment experiences of SAGA, e.\,g.\ by moving the
responsibility of correctly deployed grid-middleware to the resource providers
and not the end-users, should be an effective solution.
\amnote{last paragraph is somewhat hard to parse (first sentence).}

% Lack of interoperability also stems from the difference in the
% semantics; it is not wishful thinking that in addition to having a
% common and consistent API, PJ frameworks change their internal
% functioning to be make the consistent with the P* Model explicit.

\note{TROY provides a
  unified API that can be used to expose various PJ frameworks
  (e.\,g.\ BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G). Further, it enables the
  concurrent usage of multiple PJ frameworks (see
  figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}).  The SAGA inspired
  approach to TROY's API design --- its SAGA inspired adaptor-based
  architecture, leverage the design experiences of SAGA, are appealing
  to the pilot-job user community. Also, the chosen designs enables
  the easy exchange of PJ implementations and the concurrent use of
  multiple PJ frameworks. TROY thus functions as common access layer
  for different PJ frameworks, providing interoperability and
  portability of PJ applications. To some extent, the TROY API can be
  considered to be a prototype of a PJ-like API extension to SAGA (see
  Discussion \& future work, \S\ref{sec:discussion-future-work}).}

% \alnote{not sure about the capital letters in the (i) enumerations.
% We don't use this style anywhere else}
P* provides significant future research, development \& deployment
extensions and opportunities. We discuss one opportunity along each of
these axes: (i) Development and Extension: On the basis of successful
validation of the P* Model, we proposed extensions to include data,
i.e., PD and associated abstractions. However, only a prototype
implementation of BigData exists; providing a unified implementation
with BigJob and presenting these unified abstractions within the Pilot-API will
support advanced dynamic execution modes and enhance the range of
applications that will benefit from the pilot abstraction; (ii)
Research Issues: These developments and extensions will also provide
the basis to explore and reason on the relative roles of system versus
application-level scheduling and heuristics for dynamic execution;
(iii) Deployment: Currently, the widely used Condor-G 
framework is invoked via the Condor-SAGA adaptor; however, although
the performance difference will be negligible, there will be
significant ease of distribution if the Condor capabilities are directly 
integrated into TROY while retaining the advantage of a
common consistent API to the PJ frameworks and functionality.
\msnote{Not sure how iii fits in now}
% This
% should also result increased scalability.\alnote{not sure whether this is
% a significant scalability factor.}


In summary, we will use existing and emerging capabilities of TROY to
support the efficient and scalable solution of many scientific
applications that involve multiple independent tasks.\alnote{just one sentence - can be merged with paragraph above.}


\note{Future Work: TROY - tests on scalability and direct
  DIANE/Condor-G adaptors (more dev work) Claim BigData and BigJob
  into TROY and provide a unified Explore application with dynamic
  execution requirements: explore various kinds of dynamic execution

% Without the advantages of scalability and extensibility arising from
% abstractions

% we propose a model for an
% abstraction of pilot-job frameworks.


% we will align the TROY API with the emerging SAGA Resource Management

% To perform the above experiments we built an application \smnote{this

% \cu 's with different input files to different backend implementations. The \cu 's
% are completely handled and submitted to different backends by TROY and the
% co-ordination of \cu 's was made simple for the application. Further, applications
% can also continuously monitor status of remote agents and UOWs.

% Further, it shows that both PJ implementations can be used
% concurrently. This is particularly useful if the time-to-completion can be
% reduced in cases where resources on another infrastructure are available.





% Figure~\ref{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj} shows the results of the
% experiments. The time-to-completion for TROY-DIANE is about 207\,sec
% longer than for TROY-SAGA. The main contributor for this increased
% runtime is the deployment time required for DIANE. In a multi-node
% setup multiple work agents must be used (8 in this case).  For each
% worker agent DIANE must be downloaded, installed and started
% separately. In total this requires about 178\,sec. Further, each DIANE
% worker agent is queued as a separate job at the local resource manager
% -- this contributes the the higher deviation in the measured
% runtimes. Because BigJob requires a pre-run installation on each site,
% it only shows a startup time of 28\,sec. Additionally, we also
% observed a runtime overhead of about 17\,sec for the TROY-DIANE
% scenario. This overhead is likely caused by the additional agents
