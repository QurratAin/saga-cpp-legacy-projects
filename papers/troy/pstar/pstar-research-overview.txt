Pstar Research Overview, Tracks and timelines

Following several years of in-depth analysis of DCI (eg DPA theme,
SAGA project) and implementing applications that can utilize them, we
believe that the Pilot abstraction provides a unique opportunity to
revisit the theory and practise of distributed CI.  Interestingly,
although the pilot abstraction has seemingly been "around" for many
years, we provide a fresh if not radically different perspecitve of
the pilot abstraction and establish its use, capabilities and theory
in hitherto previously unknown ways.

Track 0 Core Pstar Model: To provide a common analytical framework to
understand the most commonly used pilot-jobs, provide a logical
extension to data (pilot-data).  The P* model descripes a set of
necessary common elements for every pilot system, followed by a
description of the characteristics that determine the interaction of
these elements and the overall functioning of a pilot system.  P*
provides a common minimal model that in principle capture all pilot
abstractions. Differences between different pilot systems are in
captured in the different characteristics and elements.

An important strand within Core Pstar Track is the design and
implementation of Pilot-Data..

Track 1 Pilot-API

Track 3 Pilots as a runtime environment for executing workflows

Track 4 TROY: Pilot system Interoperation and Application-level Scheduling

Track 5 Actuated and Intelligent Pilots
