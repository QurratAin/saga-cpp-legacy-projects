**Scenario Performance:

Aim: 
- measure overhead for TROY/Pilot-Job/Agent

Workload:
1) 128 WU /bin/date
2) BFAST Sequence Alignment

Resources:
- fixed to 16 cores

TROY adaptors:
- DIANE
- BigJob Advert
- BigJob Redis
- BigJob Zookeeper

Metric:
- Time-to-completion with the following breakdown:
	- pilot queuing time
	- coordination overhead: Time to WU dispatch


**Scenario Performance - Hybrid infrastructures:
- as above but with DIANE/BigJob hybrid setup


**Scenario Scalability:

Aim: 
- test max. achievable throughput of WUs

Workload:
- constant workload per core, e.g. 16 /bin/date

Resources:
- 8, 16, 32, 64 cores
- 128, 256, 512, 1024 WUs

TROY adaptors:
- see above

Metric:
- #WU/sec
