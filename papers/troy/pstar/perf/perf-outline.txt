**Scenario Performance:

Aim: 
- measure overhead for TROY/Pilot-Job/Agent

Workload:
1) 128 WU /bin/date
2) BFAST Sequence Alignment

Resources:
- fixed to 16 cores

TROY adaptors:
- DIANE
- BigJob Advert
- BigJob Redis
- BigJob Zookeeper

Metric:
- Time-to-completion with the following breakdown:
	- pilot queuing time
	- coordination overhead: Time to WU dispatch

**Scenario Performance - Hybrid infrastructures:
- Performance of the above scenarios just through the TROY layer
- as above but with DIANE/BigJob hybrid setup

**Scenario Scalability:

Aim: 
- test max. achievable throughput of WUs

Workload:
- constant workload per core, e.g. 16 /bin/date
- increase the #wu for a constant core

Resources:
- 8, 16, 32, 64 cores
- 128, 256, 512, 1024 WUs



(i) Would like to also determine performance degradation under
differing load , i.e. number of WUs. Is it the advert service? Is it
the number of agents? Or what?

(ii) Also, Compare to native (base) DIANE or other non-TROY native
implementations.

TROY adaptors:
- see above

Metric:
- #WU/sec
