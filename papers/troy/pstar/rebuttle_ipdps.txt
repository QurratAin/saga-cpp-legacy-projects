I. Overview/Opening saying what we think is/are the unique
contribution(s) of the paper. [SJ]

II. Acknowledge short comings, and address how we will fix them. Does
not have been specific but could be high-level.  Important to point
out how in-spite of shortcomings main contributions as in I are not
undermined, i.e., shortcomings can be/will be fixed. (ie.  urge
shepherding). [SJ/AL]

- motivation for P* model: We will improve the motivation for section II.

- respectfully claim that TROY overhead have been addressed

- only covers Pilot-Jobs => future work: pilot-data, scheduling, etc. Application to data has never been done before

- no related work: we have references (<30% self-refs); section 4 is a 
discussion of related work

- experiments Pilot-Data => future work

III. Address Specific comments, and either dispute or
acknowledge. Either way focus on how we will improve the individual
sections.

In turn, each section in III has two tracks: (i) why we agree/disagree
with specific comments, (ii) How we will improve individual sections,
either taking into account the referee remarks or of our own volition
(again making the case for shepherding).
