I. Overview/Opening saying what we think is/are the unique
contribution(s) of the paper. [SJ]

II. Acknowledge short comings, and address how we will fix them. Does
not have been specific but could be high-level.  Important to point
out how inspite of shortcomings main contributions as in I are not
undermined, i.e., shortcomings can be/will be fixed. (ie.  urge
shepherding). [SJ/AL]


III. Address Specific comments, and either dispute or
acknowledge. Either way focus on how we will improve the individual
sections.

In turn, each section in III has two tracks: (i) why we agree/disagree
with specific commments, (ii) How we will improve individual sections,
either taking into account the referee remarks or of our own volition
(again making the case for shepherding).
