\begin{abstract}
  Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications require dynamical
  resource utilization models and not static resources.  Pilot-Jobs
  have been one notable success -- in the scope of usage and number of
  CI that support them and applications that use them.  However, in
  spite of broad uptake, there does not exist a well defined, unifying
  theoretical framework for Pilot-Job using which different
  implementations can be compared, contrasted and defined. This paper
  is an attempt to (i) provide a minimal but complete model/framework
  of Pilot-Jobs, (ii) extend the basic framework from compute jobs to
  data, (iii) introduce TROY (tiered resource overlay) as an
  implementation of this framework using SAGA, i.e., consistent with
  its API, job-model etc., (iv) mapping DIANE -- an existing and well
  known PJ -- to P*, we establish the generality of the
  model/framework (P*), (v) establish and validate the implementation
  of the TROY API by concurrently using BigJob and DIANE across
  multiple infrastructures.

The primary objectives of this work are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Establish the need for dynamic execution of applications -
  distributed as well as high-end performance.

\item We define the basic characteristics of the dynamic apps and we
  understand the requirements of dynamic apps need to do in a
  distributed environment.

\item We understand the capability that must be provided by the
  infrastructure to support these application

\item We describe the pilot-job as a good prototype of an abstraction
  that supports dynamic execution

\item We define the characteristics that need to be supported by a
  pilot-job \jhanote{Infrastructure or Application characteristics?}
  \alnote{I think we meant application characteristics}

\item There exist multiple PJ implementations out there but no way to
  compare and contrast. Provide a framework to aid an understanding of
  pilot-jobs and the ability to compare, contrast and understand
  different pilot-jobs.  Provide both a theoretical and empirically
  useful approach to determining which PJ to use

\item Empirical implementation of TRoY and demonstration of
  concurrent/interoperation between equivalent but distinct Pilot-Job
  implementation. Highlight unique feature of Troy: User extensible
  and customisable. \jhanote{We should talk about this in light of the
    reviews of the paper with Bishop}
\end{enumerate}

Points 1-3 can go into the beginning of \S 2.  Points 4 \& 5 should be
addressed in both introduction (see one of the \jhanote{} above), as
well as in the beginning of \S 2. Points 6, 7 are addressed in the
Introduction.

\section{Introduction and Overview}

Distributed infrastructure almost by definition is comprised  of a
set of resources that are fluctuating -- growing, shrinking, changing
in load and capability.  The ability to respond to such changes is
thus an important attribute of any application that wants to utilize
distributed infrastructure efficiently, as opposed to a static
execution model characteristic of parallel and cluster computing.

% The ability to use resources dynamically
% and how they are provisioned and federated, it is {\it ipso facto}
% determined that

In addition, the evolution or internal dynamics of an application may
vary, thereby changing the resource requirement or utilization
ability; this has the resultant effect of an application being
dynamic, though dynamic resource execution maybe just one of multiple
responses.
 
For example, different solvers, or granularity of existing solvers,
adaptive algorithms and/or implementations, can also provide
applications with an agile execution model, effectively equivalent to
dynamic resource utilization. The two approaches can be viewed as
different approaches to the dynamic resource problem: in one, the
supply is kept fixed and the demand is changed to meet the supply; in
the other the supply changes in response to the demand.

For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the latter, wherein
the availabilty and utilization of resources changes...  As a
consequence, we will not consider dynamic execution arising from
internal application changes.  In other words, we wil concern
and confine ourselves to  % distributed
% cyberinfrastructure and applications 
the case where applications have the ability to respond to a
fluctuating resource pool, i.e., the set of resources utilized at
$T=$1, is not the same as $T=$0.  Typically, this will involve a
single ``large'' distributed application, that is comprised of many
smaller tasks.

 

% Additionally, existing development and execution models and
% abstractions are mostly remnants of cluster and high-performance
% computing -- which almost by definition impose and imply a static
% resource utilization model. \jhanote{Define/elaborate on static
%   resource model.}  



% At this point, it is worth elaborating upon dynamic resource
% utilization;

There exist two models of dynamic resource utilization, which we refer
to as the weak (probabilistic) model of DE and the strong
(deterministic) model of DE. In the former, there exists a certain
probability to acquire a resource at a given instant of time; in the
latter the probability of acquiring a resource is by definition is 1,
but there exists a broad range of times over which this probabilty
will first be 1.  Multiple approaches exist to support dynamic resource
utilization -- both weak and strong.  For example, Advanced Scheduling
(without pre-emption) provides a guarantee (probability of 1) at a
sufficiently far out time window. 

Another common approach is the Pilot-Job apporach, wherein there is a
decoupling between workload management and resource
assignment/scheduling.  Along with empirical evidence, our experience
suggests that distributed applications that are able to use tools,
abstractions and services that break the coupling between workload
management and resource assignment/scheduling have been more
successful at efficiently utilizing distributed resources.  In
addition the ability to provide these capability in user-space, leads
to the basic concept of a pilot-job.

%from % break the coupling 

% Introduce late-binding and user-level to complete the
% ``definition'' of pilot-job..

On reflection, distributed applications that strongly and statically
(early) bind to resources, have been less successful at efficiently
utilizing distributed resources, as well are unlikely to be able to
scale -- either due to hindrances arising from failures, unpredictable
system loads and or changing application requirements and resource
availability, amongst other factors.


%One effective way of supporting dynamic

% \jhanote{Need a sentence a two explaining/making the connection
%   between pilot-jobs and dynamic resource assignment} Applications
% using the Pilot-Job abstraction provide the strongest confirmation of
% this assertion~\cite{} \jhanote{Need good citation}.

In general, there exist multiple reasons why distributed applications
have not been able to utilize distributed cyberinfrastructure
effectively and without immense effort~\cite{dpa_surveypaper}.  At the
root of the problem is the fact that developing large-scale
distributed applications is fundamentally a difficult process. The
range of proposed tools, programming systems and environments is
bewildering large, making integration, extensibility and
interoperability difficult.

Interestingly there exists many implementations of the Pilot-Job
abstraction, wherein different projects and users have rolled-out
their own. The fact that users have voted with their feet for
Pilot-Jobs, reinforces the fact that the Pilot-Job is both an useful
and correct abstraction for distributed cyberinfrastructure; the fact
that it has become an ``unregulated cottage industry'' reaffirms the
lack of common nomenclature, integration, interoperability and
extension.


Our work is motivated by the existing status of the usage and
availability of the Pilot-Job abstraction vis-a-vis the current
landscape of distributed applications and cyberinfrastructure.

%\subsection*{Motivation}

% \jhanote{Not sure yet if we should have ``Motivation and Aims'' as a
%   stand alone section, and if so how to name that section....or if we
%   should wrap it into \S 1..}



% The real power of distributed systems, however, arises from adaptive
% algorithms and implementations that provide applications with an agile
% execution model, and thus the ability to use resources dynamically as
% opposed to a static execution model inherited from parallel and
% cluster computing



% \jhanote{refine erstwhile motivation} Distributed cyberinfrastructure
% are inherently dynamic: resources can suddenly fail or new resources
% can become available at any time. Generally there are two types of
% dynamism.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Resource dynamism:} Distributed systems are inherently dynamic
%      -- resources can become available or fail at any time. The same holds for
%       network connections. Further, hybrid infrastructures comprised of 
%       different resources classes can vary significantly in their costs for 
%       usage, performance, availability and the guarantees for quality of service 
%       they provide.
      
% \item \textbf{Application dynamism} describes the requirement of many
% applications to support dynamic resource requirements. An example are
% applications whose execution time resource requirements cannot be determined
% exactly in advance (either due to changes in runtime requirements) or those that
% are dependent on dynamic data (e. g. sensor, in-transit or variable source/sink
% of data). Further, the application requirements may change, due to,
% for example, a failure or an application event.
% \end{itemize}

% Further things to consider:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item dynamic scheduling
%     \item dynamic task placement
%     \item autonomic behaviors: Monitoring of the system/application state and 
%     adaptations of the application and/or resources to respond to changing 
%     requirements or environment.
%   \item Multi-level and multi-dimensional scheduling (in a distributed
%     context). Make reference to it.
% \end{itemize}


%\section*{Aims} 


To achieve our objectives, we begin this work with an attempt to
provide a minimal, but complete model -- for the Pilot-Job
abstraction, to provide a common and consistent framework to compare
and contrast different Pilot-Jobs. This is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first such attempt.

A natural and logical extension of the Pilot-Job model, arising from
the need to treat data as a first-class schedulable entity, is a
concept analogous to Pilot-Job: the Pilot-Data. Given the consistent
treatment of data and compute, as potentially equal components in a
framework to support dynamic resource and execution, we refer to as
the P-* Model ("P-star").

In \S3 we introduce TROY -- A Tiered Resource Overlay framework, as an
implementation of the P-* Model using the SAGA API. The Pilot-Job and
Pilot-Data concepts in TROY are referred to as BigJob and BigData; as
we will discuss, consistent with the goals and aims of SAGA, there can
be multiple {\it atomic} instances of BigJob for different backends.
Thus we posit that the TROY API is a general purpose API that can be
used for all Pilot-Jobs. Before validating this claim, in \S4 of this
paper, we discuss the mapping of DIANE to the P-* Model and outline
briefly how other well known Pilot-Jobs can be understood using the
{\it vectors}~\cite{dpa_surveypaper} of the P-* Model.

In \S5 we validate the TROY API by demonstrating how DIANE -- an
existing and widely used Pilot-Job, can be given a well defined API
via the TROY-BigJob API. To further substantiate the impact of
TROY-BigJob API, we will demonstrate interoperability between
different Pilot-Jobs -- a native SAGA based Pilot-Job, referred to as
bigjob/advert with DIANE.  We believe this is also the first
demonstration of interoperation of different Pilot-Jobs.

\jhanote{Should we to introduce Dynamic Applications explicitly in the
  title? Just a question, not a suggestion...}

  Dynamic Execution \jhanote{All}}
\label{sec:pilot-model}


The uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific applications
has been limited by the availability of extensible, pervasive and
simple-to-use abstractions which are required at multiple levels –
development, deployment and execution stages of scientific
applications. The Pilot-Job abstraction has been shown to be an
effective abstraction to address many requirements of scientific
applications. Specifically, Pilot-Jobs support the decoupling of
workload submission from resource assignment; this results in a
flexible execution model, which in turn enables the distributed
scale-out of applications on multiple and possibly heterogeneous
resources. Most Pilot-Job implementations however, are tied to a
specific infrastructure. In this paper, we describe the design and
implementation of a SAGA-based Pilot-Job, which supports a wide range
of application types, and is usable over a broad range of
infrastructures, i.e., it is general-purpose and extensible, and as we
will argue is also interoperable with Clouds.

\subsection{Elements of the P-* Model}


\begin{enumerate}[A.]

\item \textbf{Pilot-Job Framework:} The PJ framework provides the abstraction of 
a container for multiple Unit of Works that may be dynamically added to it 
independently from the underlying resource pool.  It provides a mechanism to 
decouple unit of works (the compute ``tasks'') from being  hard-coded to a 
specific ``resource'' or delay the binding. 

  \note{Tasks are ultimately loaded onto specific resources using the
    pilot-job and late-binding. In other words} \note{PJ provides a
    mechanism to decouple “task coordination” from “resource
    mapping”.}

  \note{Facilities provided include the creation of a PJ, insertion of
    tasks, and attachment to a CPU resource pool for late-binding task
    execution.}
	\alnote{Remark from AndreM: we need to careful when talking about Pilot-Job 
	as a framework and Pilot-Job as the placeholder job (agent).}

\item \textbf{Pilot-Job:} The PJ (also referred to as pilot) is the entity that 
actually gets submitted and scheduled on a resource (\ref{resource}). Commonly, 
the PJ utilizes an agent to manage the set of allocated resources.

\item \textbf{Unit of Work (UW):} A unit of work is the workload that 
    encapsulates a self-contained piece of work and will be assigned to a 
    resource indirectly via a Pilot-Job.  The PJ in turn has flexibility in 
    determining when and how-many resources the UW will receive.

\item \textbf{Unit of Scheduling (US):} are entities 
  that get scheduled to the resource, and to which UWs are assigned
  (inside the PJ framework). A sub-job runs an instance of the application
  kernel~\ref{application-program}.

% are the unit of works that are sent down to \ref{pilot-agent} to be
%   executed.  Sub-jobs/jobs are used to reserve the resources required
%   by a task.

\jhanote{I changed the US description significantly} 


\item \textbf{Resource:} A storage/compute resource that has a common
  entry point (like a queue). Commonly, a resource is accessed by a 
  LRM. \alnote{move to impl. section} \label{resource}

\item \textbf{Application:} is upper layer on the stack
  e.g. DARE-NGS. The application utilizes the BigJob API to execute
  instances of \ref{application-program}. \label{application}

\item \textbf{Application Kernel:} An application kernel is actual
  binary that gets run, e.g. \texttt{/usr/local/bin/bfast}
  (Alternative terms: Program, Executable,
  Software). \label{application-program}
	
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Relationship between Unit of Work and Scheduleable Entity}
    \label{fig:figures_task-job1}
\end{figure}    

\note{to be moved to end}
\noindent
Example usage mode of a pilot job:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The pilot is executed on a certain resource.
    \item UW gets bound to a pilot-job via the central manager. 
    \alnote{I think at this point we must 
    clearly differentiate between pilot (aka the submitted agent) and pilot (aka 
    the framework)}
    \item UW gets scheduled to a US  (either one or multiple UW can be 
     scheduled to a US). The properties of the US are dependent on the pilot job 
     which they are running in. Scheduling has in addition to the spatial 
     component (which US?) also a temporal component (at what time?).
    \item US gets scheduled to a physical resource on which the pilot is 
     operating.
\end{enumerate}


% \textbf{Diane Definition of Terms: } The computation consists of many worker
% processes which communicate with one master process (the worker processes do not
% need to share the filesystem nor memory). The ensemble of computation is called
% a run and it consists of many tasks which may be executed in parallel. A task is
% defined as a set of parameters which are produced by the RunMaster (running on a
% master node) and consumed by the WorkerAgent (running on a worker node).
% 
% from 
% 
% DIANE assumes the master-worker computing model (Fig.
% 1). Client sends job parameters to the Planner which partitions
% the job into smaller tasks executed by the Workers. Integrator
% is responsible for merging the results of task execution and
% sending the final job outcome to the Client.


\subsection{Characteristics of P*-Model:}
\label{sec:p_star_elements}

We propose a set of fundamental properties/characteristics that aid the 
description of P* frameworks. Further, these properties are important for the 
implementation of P-*.

\textbf{Coordination:} describes how the various components of the 
pilot-job framework are internally coordinated. Commonly, 
distributed coordination mechanisms, such as master-worker or a 
set of distributed software agents are utilized.
     \begin{itemize}
     			\item \textbf{Decision Making:} In the \textbf{central} model 
				information about available resources (aka 	pilots) are 
				collected by a central manager.  Decisions are centrally 
     			made by a manager process, which decides which UW is executed on 
				what resource. In the \textbf{hierarchical} 
				model the decision making process is divided up into a hierarchy 	
				of distributed agents. Each of them coordinates a coordinates a 
				defined aspect (e.\,g.\ a certain set of resources). In the 
				\textbf{decentral} model, control is distributed among the 
     			different components. Pilot-Jobs with decentralized decision 
     			making often utilize agents that accepts respectively pull 
     			UWs according to a set of defined criteria.

				\item \textbf{Push versus Pull Model:} We define the terms push 
				and pull based upon the determinism of the binding. If
				the task is centrally explicitly addressed to a specific pilot, 
				and there is thus no freedom for a pilot to select the task, we 
				speak of a push model. In all other situations, when there is a 
				degree of freedom for the pilots to select a task, we speak of 
				pull. This model is applicable to different aspects of the 
				pilot-job framework (e.g. to task binding, resource binding, 
				resource additions/removals).    \alnote{should we move 
				push/pull to communication? It's is also currently references 
				there already}     		
     \end{itemize}
	 
    % \item \textbf{Coordination} describes how the various components of 
    % the Pilot-Job framework are coordinated. Possible values for this vector 
    % include data flow, control flow, SPMD (where the control flow is implicit in 
    % all copies of the single program), master-worker (the work done by the 
    % workers is controlled by the master). 
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \item The data flow describes the flow of messages between the 
    %   components of the framework, e.\,g.\ point-to-point messaging or 
    %   publish-subscribe (see Communication).
    %   \item The control flow describes how the various components of the
    %    framework are managed. In the context of pilot-jobs this particularly 
    %    means how the resource on which a sub-job is executed is determined. 
	% \item Sub-Job pull vs. push applies to control and data flow (different 
	% objects that are pushed/pulled)

\textbf{Communication:} describes the mechanisms for data exchange between the
components of the framework, can be used (e.\,g.\ point-to-point, all-to-all,
one-to-all, all-to-one, or group-to-group), stream (potentially unicast or
multicast), publish/subscribe or shared data spaces. Shared data spaces (e.\,g.\
tuple spaces) as used by BigJob are associated with a push/pull coordination
schema, i.e. the central manager pushes something to the shared data space and
the agents periodically check for new data.
		
% \textbf{Dynamic Resources:} Dynamic resources describes the ability 
% 	to acquire and release resources at runtime of the pilot-job.
% 	    \alnote{By definition a BJ should be dynamic. After acquiring additional 
% 	    resources, the external coordination is the same for both BJ.}

\textbf{UW Binding} defines how and at what time the assignment of a UW to a 
Pilot-Job is done.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Time of binding describes the point at which the binding decision 
		is made, e.\,g.\ in the case of early binding the decision is made by 
		the application, while in late binding mode the decision is made by the 
		middleware framework.
		\item Explicit binding refers to the ability to explicitly 
		request a certain resource for a UW.		
	\end{itemize}
    %   \begin{itemize}
    %       \item In the traditional early binding approach a job carries
    %        exactly one task which is specified at a time of job submission.
    %       \item Partial binding?
    %       \item Late binding is a scheduling and coordination
    %        method, where work is assigned to a job at runtime rather than at
    %        submission time.
    %       \begin{itemize}
    %           \item At sub-job submission 
    %           \item After sub-job submission
    %       \end{itemize}
    % \end{itemize}
\textbf{UW Scheduling:} Task scheduling describes i) the process of  
	mapping UW to US (pilot internal) and ii) of mapping US to physical 
	resources (pilot external). Scheduling decisions are made on basis of a 
	defined set of policies (e.g. resource capabilities, data/compute 
	affinities, etc.).
	\begin{itemize}
	 			\item Multi-level scheduling: In a distributed environment often multiple levels of autonomous schedulers are involved. 
	 			\begin{itemize}	 			  
	 			   \item The pilot job is schedules using the local RMS or some 
	 			   other Grid (meta)-scheduler.
	 			   \item UW are scheduled to US on application-level within the 
	 			   pilot-job.
	 			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	
	
    % \item \textbf{Agent:} Does every pilot-job implementation have an agent? 
    % What are the tasks of an agent? \alnote{Decision for now: agent is not a 
    % fundamental component. Can we cover this in other components, e.g. discuss 
    % multi-level scheduling in task scheduling.}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Wikipedia Definition: may refer to one who acts for, or in the 
    %     place of, another, by authority from him; one entrusted with the 
    %     business of another.
    %     \item Difference between implementation and role of agent
    %     \item Agent explicitly in the model? Or requirements that must be met by 
    %     some component in the model?
    %     \item \textbf{Roles of an agent:}
    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item manages control flow
    %         \item mapping tasks to resources
    %         \item resource management
    %         \item coordination between different components
    %         \item state management of the complete pilot job state
    %         \item discovering local information
    %         \end{itemize}

\subsection{Pilot-Data: Extension of P* to Dynamic Data}
\label{sec:pilot-data}

% \jhanote{We should purely by analogy go with BigData, no? Need a
%   diagram that talks about TROY = BigJob + BigData + ``??''. Need to
%   define ``??''}

\jhanote{note: DARE == Dynamic Application Runtime Environment: TROY +
  MapReduce + Other capabilities}

% \jhanote{Ideally the background/underlying theory of Pilot Data/Store
%   should be presented outside of TROY -- not sure this will be
%   possible, or where, possibly in the \S II? Maybe as an explicit \S
%   II-D, where we say, ``having defined a P-* model, we extend it to
%   Dynamic Data..''}

\subsubsection{Overview}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/pilotstore.pdf}
    \caption{Pilot Data and Store Overview}
    \label{fig:figures_pilotstore}
\end{figure}

Having defined the P* model, we extend this model to dynamic data using a set of 
abstraction that we call \emph{Pilot-Data}. Pilot-Data is a set of abstractions 
for expressing data localities and affinities. Pilot-Data can be used to create 
groups of file clustered together using a quantifiable property, such as 
affinity ($\alpha$) e.g., $\alpha = 1.0$ would imply that files are always 
stored together. \jhanote{I've distinguished store and usage} The concept of
correlated access originates in 
Filecules~\cite{Doraimani:2008:FGS:1383422.1383429}.


Pilot-Data provides a set of basic operations on top of these file
groups, whilst Pilot Store is a container that represents a logical
group of physical files that share the same affinity. Pilot-Store 
containers can be used to express data-data affinities. The abstraction 
supports basic management tasks (create, delete, update,
move, list). 

The Pilot-Data abstraction serves the following needs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reservation of physical disk space: acquisition of data storage (advanced reservation, place holder)
	\item Virtual destination: dynamically mapping of data to pilot stores.
	\item Runtime environment for $\alpha$ based data
	\item Automatic data partitioning and distribution
\end{itemize}


The Pilot-Data abstraction defines the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Unit:} The base unit of data used by the framework, e.\,g.\ a data 
    file or chunk.
    \item \textbf{Pilot-Data (PD):} Allows the logical grouping of files and the 
expression of data-data affinities. This collection of files can be associated with certain properties. One of this property is affinity.    
    \item \textbf{Pilot-Store (PS):} Binds a pilot-data object to a actual physical resource. A pilot-store object can function as a placeholder object that reserves the space for a pilot-data object.
\end{itemize}

A pilot-data object is a logical container and describes the properties of a 
group of files. A pilot-store is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of 
storage. By associating a pilot data object to a pilot store the data is 
actually moved to the physically location managed by the pilot store.
Pilot-Data supports commonly occurring application patterns, such as the 
scatter/gather pattern commonly used by  master-worker or 
MapReduce-applications.

While the application-level abstraction enables application developers to model 
data affinities, dependencies etc., the runtime framework will be responsible 
for managing data-compute co-allocations, data-transfers, the dynamic expansion of storage pools etc. 

\alnote{insert Millau figure}

\subsubsection{Extension of P*-Model}

The P* model can in many parts be applied to Pilot-Data: The communication and
coordination element e.\,g.\ describes important characteristics of a Pilot-Data
implementation. The elements defined in section~\ref{sec:p_star_elements} can be
extended by the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Characteristics:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Static data refers to data that is infrequently changed and does not 
	need to be moved.
    \item Dynamic data refers to different spatial and temporal properties of 
	data:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Data that is generated or changing at runtime (temporal).
    	\item Data that is in place or needs to be moved (spatial).
    \end{itemize}
	\item Streaming data
    \end{itemize}  
	\item \textbf{Data Access Patterns: } While the P* is 
	primarily concerned with capturing aspects of distributed coordination, this 
	elements is extended to include patterns of data access.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Co-Access: a collection of data that is always accessed together
		\item One-to-One: two data objects that are always accessed together (a 
		special case of co-access)
		\item One-to-All:
		\item All-to-All:
		\item Scatter:
		\item Gather:
	\end{itemize}      
    \item \textbf{Affinities:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data-Data affinity arises when different data-sets/elements are 
		required to be at the same compute element.
		\item Compute-Compute may arise, for example, either if C1 and C2 are 
		related by a data-element D, which could be the output of C1 and is the 
		required input for C2 (Case-I), or if both C1 and C2 need to operate on 
		(replicas of) the same data-element (Case-II)
        \item Data-Compute		
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit of Scheduling} describes the core unit of data that is 
	used by the framework.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chunk-based
        \item File-based
    \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data management:} Managing input and output files can be 
		critical in particular with the current increase of data volumes. 
		Pilot-Jobs can support different kinds of data management, e.\,g.\ file 
		stage-in and 
		out. Data and UW must be efficiently scheduled obeying data-data and 
		data-compute affinities. 

    \item \textbf{Data Unit Binding and Scheduling:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Affinity-based scheduling
        \item Data-transfer scheduling
    \end{itemize}    
\end{itemize}

Pilot-Job and Pilot-Data encapsulate cross-cutting properties across data and 
computation. Both Pilot-Job and Pilot-Data can be used to express affinities 
between data and compute elements. 



\subsection{Implementation Considerations}

To implement the P* model, additional consideration must be taken e.\,g.\ the 
exposed end-user abstraction and usage model, the type of communication (API or 
service) etc. In the following we will use the developed framework to develop 
the TROY-based implementation of the P* model. 

The PJ framework must define the usage model, i.\,e.\ how are resources
allocated, UW specified and assigned, as well as the way how the framework can
be accessed, e.\,g.\ via a service or API. Pilot-Jobs can be run on different
types of homogeneous and heterogeneous resources. Generally, the Local Resource
Manager (LRM) is the gateway to local resources. This can be e.\,g.\ a
PBS/Torque or WMS service. HPC resources are specifically designed for high-end
parallel jobs, while HTC resources are particularly suited for 
independent ensemble of tasks. Different applications require a mix of HTC and
HPC, e.\,g.\ when running an ensemble of MPI jobs. 
Different workload characteristics (UW heterogeneities, parallelism, UW dependencies, etc.) can be supported by a Pilot-Job, e.\,g.\ via special information collector and scheduler capabilities.

Further, non-functional properties must be considered:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Fault tolerance:} Large, distributed Grids are highly dynamic 
		and inherently prone to failures and thus unreliable. To deal with failures, 
		systems can deploy strategies, such as automatic resubmission etc.
		\item \textbf{Security}
		\begin{itemize}
	       \item Authorization, authentication, accounting (AAA) describes the 
	       authentication and authorization mechanisms supported by the PJ (e.\,g.\  
	       GSI, VOMS, MyProxy, etc.). 
		   \item Single vs. multiple user: A pilot-job that runs under the identity 
		   of a single user and is only able to accept jobs from this user is 
		   referred to as private PJ. A PJ that is able to accept jobs from 
		   different users is referred to as public PJ.
		\end{itemize}
		% \item \textbf{Resource abstraction} describes the framework that is used for accessing distributed resources (e.\,g.\ SAGA, GANGA, JGlobus etc.).
\end{itemize}

  \jhanote{AL, MS, SM}}
%Pilot-Abstraction for Dynamic Execution 

% \jhanote{Mark to put in a para about how the API implements different
%  Pilot-Jobs} \msnote{In hindsight not sure why it was at this place,
%  and what you expected but here is an attempt:}

\jhanote{Need to define and motivate TROY better, i.e. TROY: BigJob +
  BigData etc.}

TROY is a SAGA-based implementation of the P* model defined in
section~\ref{sec:pilot-model}. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figures_troy} the
framework is located on top of the SAGA API and runtime environment, which is
utilized for job management, data transfer and distributed coordination. The
TROY API maintains the SAGA Look \& Feel and was designed to be similar to SAGA
in appearance and philosophy: it re-uses many of the well defined (and
standardized) semantics and syntax of the File, Job and Advert API. Further, we
aimed for a simple-to-use API exposing as least amount of details necessary.
TROY supports different usage modes i) it provides stand-alone Pilot-Job
functionalities, ii) it provides a unified API to various Pilot-Job
implementations (e.\,g.\ Condor-G and Diane) and iii) enables the concurrent
usage of multiple Pilot-Job implementations. Further, we show in 
section~\ref{sec:bigdata} how TROY is extended to support dynamic data and
affinity-based scheduling.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{BigJob: A SAGA-based Pilot-Job}

\jhanote{Alternative title: ``BigJob: TROY Pilot-Job'' ?}

\jhanote{It is CRITICAL to explain why we need to expose the details
  of multiple atomic BigJobs to the end-user? Remember part of the
  whole idea of the exercise is, (i) theory: to provide a framework
  for understanding any differences, (ii) practice: make all these
  differences go away from the end user!}
\alnote{Since we were not sure about the term ``atomic'', we could also use base 
bigjob, or core bigjob}


BigJob is the SAGA-based Pilot-Job implementation of the TROY
framework~\cite{bigjob_web}. It supports a wide range of application types, and
is usable over a broad range of infrastructures, i.\,e.\ it is general-purpose
and extensible. 

\alnote{not sure how deep we should go here or in sec V}
The framework consists of the API package and a runtime environment. The API
utilizes the framework and elements defined in section~\ref{sec:pilot-model}. We
define two description classes that extend the known SAGA Job Description
object, the pilot-job description and the UW description. A TROY manager
represents a pool of resources. Resources can be added by submitting a pilot-job
description to the TROY manager using the \texttt{add\_resource()} method. 
Subsequently, UW can be assigned to the TROY manager. At runtime resources can 
be added and removed at any time. 


\begin{figure*}[htbp]

            to include EGI/DIANE}}
	\label{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}
\end{figure*}

Pilot-Job implementations are plugged into the TROY runtime environment via a
thin adaptor layer. Figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job} shows the
various layers of the SAGA TROY framework. While BigJob-DIANE provides dynamic
capabilities out-of-the-box, the traditional BigJob
implementation~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} utilizes two layers: the
\emph{Core BigJob} and the \emph{Dynamic BigJob} layer. Core BigJobs are
confined to a single resource and represented by a single master process
(i.\,e.\ a single BigJob Manager). Generally, Core BigJobs are used to
encapsulate resource specifics, e.\,g.\ for a certain type of infrastructure
(Condor, Cloud, etc.). A Dynamic BigJob manages multiple Core BigJobs.

Table~\ref{tab:pilotjob_overview} summarizes the different SAGA-based
implementations and their characteristics. BigJob currently supports different
backends: SAGA BigJob can be used in conjunction with different SAGA adaptors,
e.\,g.\ the Globus, PBS, Amazon Web Service and local adaptor. In addition to
the SAGA-based reference implementation, there are various other implementations
of the BigJob API, e.\,g.\ for Amazon Web Services, Azure and Condor resources.

% Aspects that need to be addressed:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Big-Job Agent: capacity (physical size) is a property of an agent. 
% 	cardinality: how many sub-jobs can be managed by an agent?
% 	\item Sub-Job Agent: Agent assignment should be separated from resource 
% 	assignment. Agent has the freedom to assign tasks to sub-job in any way 
% 	it want. Agent can do local decisions.    
%   \item Would it make sense to use the ``internal'' versus
%     ``external'' coordination concept to distinguish sub-job
%     versus big-job agent
% \end{itemize}

In many scenarios it is beneficial to utilize multiple resources, e.\,g.\ to
accelerate the time-to-completion or to provide resilience to resource failures
and/or unexpected delays. A Dynamic BigJob consists of multiple Core
BigJobs potentially distributed across several resources and types of
infrastructures. Each BigJob manages it's own resources. An extensible scheduler
is used for dispatching UWs to the different BigJobs that are managed by a
Dynamic BigJob. Dynamic BigJobs are malleable, i.\,e.\ resources can added or be
removed. For this purpose, the dynamic BigJob provides an introspection API that applications can utilize to query the manager for a list of current resources.




% Dynamic BigJob provides the ability to dynamically add and remove resources to a 
% big-job. The API consists of two parts, the resource management and the resource 
% introspection part:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{add\_resource()}: New resources are added by starting a new
%     big-job.There are various flavors of this method:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \texttt{add\_resource(re\-sour\-ce\_dic\-tionary)}: Start another big-job on the resource defined in the \texttt{resource\_dictionary}.
%         \item \texttt{add\_resource(affinity, number\_cores)}: Add another big-job to the specified affinity group.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{remove\_resource(bigjob)}: Removes the big-job from the
%     resources.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% Higher-level wrappers that encapsulate e.\,g.\ the specific resource
% descriptions can be implemented. Further, to implement this dynamic resource
% capabilities it is necessary to provide different dynamic resource introspection
% in the dynamic big-job layer:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{get\_resources()}: returns a list of managed big-job objects.
%      Each big-job object can be queried for it's allocated resources (number 
%      nodes, number cores).
% \end{itemize}


% It uses SAGA BigJob approach to start multiple BigJobs agents 
% whether on a single resource or on multiple resources. And 
% these agents are responsible for pulling the tasks from advert 
% service and run the possible subjobs concurrently or in generations.

\jhanote{The rationale behind dynamic BJ is that for the same
  application scenario different BJ with different
  properties/characteristics may be required. Thus dynamic BJ maybe
  comprised of either homogeneous or heterogeneous atomic BJs}
\alnote{did one pass... still not perfect}




\subsubsection{BigJob for Cloud Computing}

\jhanote{Once again -- why do differences in execution details between
  grids and clouds result in the need for different atomic BJs needs
  to be explained. Must emphasis that the API remains the same.}

At the execution level, clouds differ from Clusters/Grids in at least a couple
of different ways. In cloud environments, user-level jobs are not typically
exposed to a scheduling system; a user-level job consists of requesting the
instantiation of a virtual machine (VM). Virtual machines are either assigned to
the user or not (this is an important attribute that provides the illusion of
infinite resources). The assignment of job to a VM must be done by the user (or
a middleware layer as BigJob). In contrast, user-level jobs on grids and 
clusters are exposed to a scheduling system and are
assigned to execute at a later stage. Also a description of a grid job typically
contains an explicit description of the workload; in contrast for Clouds a user
level job usually contains the container (description of the resource
requested), but does not necessarily include the workload. In other words, the
physical resources are not provisioned to the workload but are provisioned to
the container.  Interestingly, at this level of formulation, pilot-jobs attempt 
to provide a similar model of resource provisioning as clouds natively offer. 

\subsubsection{BigJob and SAGA AWS Adaptor}

BigJob provides support for various cloud computing environment. The SAGA BigJob
implementation can be used in conjunction with the AWS adaptor for SAGA to run
on EC2-based cloud infrastructures, such as FutureGrid. However, there are some 
limitations mainly caused by the restrictions of SAGA/AWS adaptor for the SAGA 
Job package. The SAGA job service object e.\,g.\ does not provide a mean to 
specify a set of resources. Using the AWS adaptor it is only possible to utilize 
a single VM instance, which must be configured prior to the run in a 
configuration file. If multiple VMs are required, the dynamic BigJob 
implementation must be used. In this case however, it is still not possible to 
run MPI jobs across multiple VMs. 
\smnote {why is it not possible to run MPI jobs across Multiple VM's?} \alnote{MPI jobs are (unless you do something outside of BJ) constraint to run
on resources managed by a single BJ agent. The agent must generate a nodefile
from this list of resource it is managing. The agent is not aware of resources
managed by another BJ)}

\subsubsection{BigJob Cloud \& BigJob Azure}

To address this limitation, BigJob-Cloud~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} was
developed. BigJob-Cloud provides an implementation of the BigJob API, which is
completely independent from the SAGA (and thus, the SAGA AWS adaptor). It
directly utilizes the Amazon tools to access cloud resources. It can manage
cluster of VM; for this purpose BigJob provides a rich interface for describing
cloud resources. For this purpose a Python dictionary is used (see
section~\ref{sec:api}). The VMs can be managed centrally by the BigJob manager:
All VMs have a public IP and there is no need to interface with a local resource
manager (SAGA BigJob e.\,g.\ evaluates the \texttt{\$PBS\_NODEFILE} to obtain a
list of resources). Thus, it is not necessary to deploy an agent on the VM - all
necessary metadata can be obtained from the AWS backend. Job are spawned via
SSH.

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item ManyJob is required to manage the set of VMs. The BigJob-Cloud can manage a set of VMs without the need of ManyJob.
%   \item Bigjob uses advert server for communication between BigJob-agent and BigJob whereas BigJob-Cloud does not use an advert server.
%   \item Bigjob-cloud does not require SAGA-AWS adaptors as opposed to requirement in original Bigjob. 
% \end{itemize} 


BigJob-Azure~\cite{10.1109/CloudCom.2010.85} utilizes a similar approach as
BigJob-Cloud. It utilizes the Azure REST interface to startup VM Worker Roles.
However, since Azure does not support SSH access it is necessary to utilize an
agent-based approach. For communication between the agent and the manager the
Azure Storage is used.

\msnote{If BigJob is the atomic unit, it should not differ per
  backend}\alnote{That's mainly a restriction of the job package which
  does not really map to AWS. There is no common way in the job
  package to specify the \# of resources that suppose to be
  used. Thus, this limitation}


\subsection{BigData: A SAGA-based Pilot-Data Implementation}
\label{sec:bigdata}
% \jhanote{theory goes upfront; implementation and architecture stays
%   here} \alnote{ok}

BigData is the SAGA-based implementation of the Pilot Data abstraction.
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job} gives an overview of the
architecture. The system consists of two components: the Pilot Data manager and
the agents deployed on a specific physical storage resource. The manager is
responsible for 1) meta-data management, i.\,e.\ it keeps track of the pilot
stores that a pilot data object is associated with and 2) it schedules data
movements and data replications taking into account the application requirements 
defined via affinities. Data placement and locality is the key for a optimal 
performance of data-intensive applications. The architecture is designed to 
function as a \textbf{user-level overlay} on top of existing storage resources.


\jhanote{Need to explain/describe architecture of BigData? using the
  terminology of Section II and P*-Model}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/pilot-data-manager.pdf}
    \caption{Pilot Data Architecture}
    \label{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}
\end{figure}

Each pilot store is managed by an agent. The agent can be started manually or 
using the Pilot Data API. A possible implementation option would be the 
integration of the PD and BigJob agent, which is particularly useful for 
managing data-/compute-affinities.

A core part of the data manager is the data scheduler. The scheduler aims for a 
optimum of data and compute locality for an applications.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Move data to compute
	\item Move computer to data
	\item Streaming of data
	\item Data prefetching 
	\item Replication
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Data Movement}

The Pilot Data implementation is based on SAGA and thus, is infrastructure
independent. It supports all underlying SAGA adaptors (SSHFS, GridFTP) and
future adaptors such as Globus Online.

Work on optimizing file transfers: Kosar[2011]

Work on reliable file transfer: RFT, Globus Online

\subsubsection{BigJob and BigData Integration}

In particular for data-intensive applications data locality is an important
concern. Different types of affinity, e.\,g.\ data-data or data-compute, exists.
Dynamic BigJob provides support for data-compute affinities. Each resource
(i.\,e.\ each big-job) can be assigned to a certain affinity. The affinity-aware
scheduler then ensures that sub-jobs that demand a certain affinity are only
executed on resources that fulfill this constraint.


\subsubsection{Related Work}

\emph{iRods}


\emph{Stork}


\emph{BitDew}

Random Notes
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus on Desktop Grid
	\item Java-based implementation (ie difficult to interface with Python-based PS/SAGA)
	\item highly distributed: stable and volatile nodes
	\item pull model, i.e. a node pulls for new data
\end{itemize}


Mapping to BitDew:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pilot Store in its current implementation covers Bitdew Data Catalog and Repository
	\item For data management and placement the Active Data API and the Bitdew data scheduler could be used
	\item Transfer Management is done via SAGA File API	
\end{itemize}

How to evolve pilot data/store?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Active management of data (e.g. replication, automatic affinity management) requires an active component:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Manager/Agent model as in BigJob?
		\item Who runs active components? Started as part of batch job or separate install/start?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How should
    we store data in order to effectively cope with non-uniform demand for
    data? 
    \item How many copies of popular data objects do we need? 
    \item Where should we store them for effective load balancing?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{TODO/Future Work}
The current framework provides building blocks for expressing data localities and operation on file groups (similar to filecules).

Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No active agent that monitors state of files
    \item No placement policy support or autonomic behavior
    \item Infrastructures generally expose insufficient locality/topology information
    \item Compute – Data Affinity: Dynamic BigJob with affinity only provides a very coarse-grained affinity
    \item No policy for what’s happening if data is not available in right location:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Run anyways – affinity is just an hint
    \end{itemize}
    \item When to move pilot stores? Move or copy?
    \item Move data to compute or visa versa?
    \item Data Replication: Identification of the same file: logical filename -> physical files. Manage replication process (consistency!)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

In the future we plan to further refine the TROY API, e.\,g.\ by generically supporting different security models via a context API (similar to the SAGA Context API).

The TROY API is available at~\cite{troy_api}.

\section{Understanding Other Pilot-Jobs \jhanote{MS - to focus on
    DIANE}}


\jhanote{Depending upon where the TROY API is discussed we can have
  two ways forward. If TROY API is discussed in \S 3, then we go for
  Mode I, where Mode I: The aim of this section is to show: (i) that
  our P* Model can be used to explain/understand DIANE, (ii) Show that
  the TROY API can be used to marshall Diane stand-alone, (iii) Using
  TROY API, both BigJob and Diane can be used standalone}

\jhanote{If TROY API is discussed in \S 5, then we go for Mode-II,
  where Mode II: The aim of \S 4 is to show: (i) that our P* Model can

  discussed TROY API we, (ii) Show that the TROY API can be used to
  marshall Diane stand-alone, (iii) Using TROY API, both BigJob and
  Diane can be used stand alone}

\jhanote{I think there was agreement to go with Mode II}

As more applications take advantage of dynamic execution, the Pilot-Job concept
has grown in popularity and has been extensively researched and implemented for
different usage scenarios and infrastructure. The aim of this section is to
show: (i) that our P* Model can be used to explain/understand DIANE as well as
other Pilot-Job frameworks.

\subsection{DIANE}

DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} is a task coordination framework which
implements the Master/Worker pattern. Table~\ref{table:bigjob-saga-diane} 
compares the BigJob-SAGA and Diane.

\alnote{Update: atomic pilot, multiple pilot model}


%\subsection{DIRAC}
% \jhanote{Dirac is not critical, and can be clubbed together with other
%   PJ implementations described below}



\subsection{Condor-G}

Condor-G pioneered the Pilot-Job concept~\cite{condor-g}. Using Condor-G 
a complete Condor pool can be initiated using the GRAM service; subsequently 
jobs can be submitted to this pool using the standard Condor tools and APIs.

\subsection{SWIFT}

SWIFT~\cite{Wilde2011} relies on its scripting language to describe abstract
workflows and computations. The language provides among many things capabilities
for executing external application as well as the implicit management of data
flows between application tasks. For this purpose, SWIFT formalizes the way that
applications can define data-dependencies. Using so called mappers dependencies
can be easily extended to files or groups of files. The runtime environment
handles the allocation of resources and the spawning of the compute tasks. Both
data- and execution management capabilities are provided via abstract
interfaces. SWIFT supports e.\,g.\ Globus, Condor and PBS resources. The pool of
resources that is used for an application is statically defined in a
configuration file. While this configuration file can refer to highly dynamic
resources (such as OSG resources), there is no way to manage this resource pool
programmatically. By default a 1:1 mapping for UW and jobs is used. However,
SWIFT supports the clustering of UWs into a single large job as well as
pilot-jobs for which the term Coaster~\cite{coasters} is used. Coaster relies on
a master-worker coordination model; communication is implemented using
GSI-secured TCP sockets.

\jhanote{It should probably be Coasters -- which is their notion of a pilot-job. Just
to keep life interesting, they call it head-job and not pilot-job!}

\alnote{SWIFT eval: no standard resource abstraction (SAGA), proprietary 
language (not Python), TODO: check how coasters work! 1 coaster == 1 Condor-G 
job?}


\subsection{Other Pilot-Jobs and Conclusion}

Table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison} compares the three Pilot-Job frameworks 
discussed in this section.

In addition to the three Pilot-Job framework discussed in this section, various
other frameworks exist.
\begin{itemize}
    \item MyCluster
    \item Falkon~\cite{1362680} is a Pilot-Job framework that emphasizes the 
	performance of its task dispatcher.
    \item Nimrod/G
    \item DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049} is another pilot-job framework 
	used by the LHCb community.
    \item Topos
    \item Panda    
\end{itemize}



\jhanote{Can we add some structure to these *other* PJ.. this will be
  ambitious and time-consuming, but if we can, that'll be (i) a great
  service to the community, (ii) a strong intellectual addition to the
  paper by virtue of validation of the P*-model}

% \jhanote{Saw the table after I wrote above jhanote. I should have
%   known Andre L would have already done this! Great job! I agree --
%   doing it for 4 PJs should be good enough}

\section{Implementations and Experiments \jhanote{AL/MS, SM}}

In this section we discuss the TROY API. Further, (i) we show that the TROY API 
can be used to  marshall DIANE stand-alone as well as (ii) that the TROY API 
can be used stand alone with both BigJob and DIANE concurrently.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


implement a more decentral distributed control mechanism in TROY
