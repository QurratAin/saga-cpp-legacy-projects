\begin{abstract}
  Distributed cyberinfrastructures (CI) and applications require the
  ability to determine and utilize resource selection at runtime,
  viz., dynamically, and not just pre-execution, viz., statically.
  Pilot-Jobs have been notable in their ability to support dynamic
  resource utilization -- in the number of applications that use them,
  in the scope of usage, as well as the number of CI that support
  them.  In spite of broad uptake, there does not exist however, a
  well defined, unifying theoretical framework for Pilot-Jobs which
  can be used to compare, contrast and define different
  implementations. This paper is an attempt to (i) provide a minimal
  but complete model (P*) of Pilot-Jobs, (ii) extend the basic model
  from compute jobs to data, (iii) introduce TROY as an implementation
  of this model using SAGA, i.\,e.\ consistent with its API, job-model
  etc., (iv) we establish the generality of the P* model by mapping
  various existing and well known Pilot-Jobs such as DIANE to P*, (v)
  establish and validate the implementation of the TROY API by
  concurrently using multiple distinct Pilot-Jobs.\upp\upp\upp\upp

\section*{Outline}
The primary objectives of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Establish the need for dynamic execution of applications -
  distributed as well as high-end performance.
\item We define the basic characteristics of the dynamic apps and we
  understand the requirements of dynamic apps need to do in a
  distributed environment.
\item We understand the capability that must be provided by the
  infrastructure to support these application
\item We describe the pilot-job as a good prototype of an abstraction
  that supports dynamic execution
\item We define the characteristics that need to be supported by a
  pilot-job \jhanote{Infrastructure or Application characteristics?}
  \alnote{I think we meant application characteristics}
\item There exist multiple PJ implementations out there but no way to
  compare and contrast. Provide a framework to aid an understanding of
  pilot-jobs and the ability to compare, contrast and understand
  different pilot-jobs.  Provide both a theoretical and empirically
  useful approach to determining which PJ to use
\item Empirical implementation of TROY and demonstration of
  concurrent/interoperation between equivalent but distinct Pilot-Job

\section{Introduction and Overview \upp\upp}

% The ability to use resources dynamically
% and how they are provisioned and federated, it is {\it ipso facto}
% determined that
 
Distributed CI almost by definition is comprised of a set of resources
that is fluctuating -- growing, shrinking, changing in load and
capability.  The ability to utilize such a dynamic resource pool is
thus an important attribute of any application that needs to utilize
distributed CI efficiently; this is in contrast to a static resource
utilization model characteristic of parallel and cluster computing.

In addition, the evolution or internal dynamics of an application may
vary, thereby changing the resource requirement.
%or utilization ability.  this has the resultant effect of an
%application being dynamic, though dynamic resource execution maybe
%just one of multiple responses.
For example, different solvers, % or granularity of existing solvers,
adaptive algorithms and/or implementations, can also provide
applications with an dynamic resource utilization requirements.  We
will define dynamic applications to have the ability to respond to a
fluctuating resource pool, i.\,e., the set of resources utilized at
$T=0$ is not the same as $T>0$.


%execution model, effectively equivalent to

%The two approaches can be viewed as different approaches to the
%dynamic resource problem.
%in one, the supply is kept fixed and the demand is changed to meet the
%supply; in the other the supply changes in response to the demand.

%For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the latter, wherein
%the availability and utilization of resources changes.  As a
%consequence, we will not consider dynamic execution arising from
%internal application changes.  
%In other words, 


% Typically, this will involve a single ``large'' distributed
% application, that is comprised of many smaller tasks.\alnote{it
%   would be good if we could relate to our DARE use case here}

% \alnote{not sure why do we need week and strong model? Determinism and
%   distributed systems don't go together well. Also, I wouldn't claim
%   that the prob. of adv. rerv. is 1 (it might be 0.99...). PJ are more
% d  in line with the weak model. Do we say that Advance Reserv. are
%   better?}  \jhanote{Addressed.} \jhanote{OK to remove?}

% There exist two models of dynamic resource utilization, which we refer
% to as the weak (probabilistic) model of dynamic execution (DE) and the
% strong (deterministic) model of DE. In the former, there exists a
% certain probability to acquire a resource at a given instant of time;
% in the latter the probability of acquiring a resource is by definition
% is 1, but there exists a broad range of times over which this
% probability will first be 1. 

Multiple approaches exist to support dynamic resource utilization, for
example, advanced scheduling (without pre-emption) provides
essentially a guarantee of resource % (probability of 1)
at a sufficiently far out time window.  Another common approach for
decoupling workload management and resource assignment/scheduling are
\emph{pilot-jobs (PJ)}. Along with empirical evidence, our experience
suggests that distributed applications that are able to use tools,
abstractions and services that break the coupling between workload
management and resource assignment/scheduling have been more
successful at efficiently utilizing distributed resources. In
addition, the ability to provide these capabilities in user-space,
leads to the basic concept of a pilot-job.

% \jhanote{Candidate for removal: On reflection, distributed
%   applications that strongly and statically (early) bind to resources,
%   have been less successful at efficiently utilizing distributed
%   resources, as well are unlikely to be able to scale -- either due to
%   hindrances arising from failures, unpredictable system loads and or
%   changing application requirements and resource availability, amongst
%   other factors.}

Interestingly there exist many implementations of the PJ
abstraction, wherein different projects and users have rolled-out
their own. The fact that users have voted with their feet for
PJs reinforces that the Pilot-Job is both an useful
and correct abstraction for distributed cyberinfrastructure; the fact
that it has become an ``unregulated cottage industry'' reaffirms the
lack of common nomenclature, integration, interoperability and
extension.

Our work is motivated by the current status of the usage and
availability of the PJ abstraction vis-a-vis the current
landscape of distributed applications and cyberinfrastructure.
To achieve our objectives, we begin this work with an attempt to
provide a minimal, but complete model -- for the PJ
abstraction, to provide a common and consistent framework to compare
and contrast different PJ implementations/frameworks. This is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first such attempt.

A natural and logical extension of the PJ model, arising from the need to treat
data as a first-class schedulable entity, is a concept analogous to PJ: the
\emph{pilot-data (PD)} abstraction. Given the consistent treatment of data and
compute, as potentially equal components in a framework to support dynamic
resource and execution, we refer this model as the P* model ("P-star").

In \S3 we introduce TROY -- A Tiered Resource OverlaY framework -- as
an implementation of the P* model using the SAGA API. The specific
pilot-job and pilot-data implementations in TROY are referred to as
BigJob and BigData. As we will discuss, consistent with the goals and
aims of SAGA, there can be multiple % {\it atomic}
instances of BigJob for different backends.  Thus we posit that the
TROY API provides an API that can be used for most, if not all
pilot-jobs. Before validating this claim, in \S4 of this paper, we
analyze and discuss several well-known pilot-jobs (DIANE,
Swift-Coaster and Condor Glide-in) using the analytical framework
provided by the P* Model.

% and outline briefly how other well known pilot-jobs can be
% understood using the {\it vectors}~\cite{dpa_surveypaper} of the P*
% Model.

In \S5 we validate the TROY API by demonstrating how DIANE -- an existing and
widely used pilot-job implementation, can be given a well defined API via the
TROY API. To further substantiate the impact of TROY API, we will demonstrate
interoperability between different PJs -- a native SAGA based PJ, referred to as
BigJob-SAGA, and DIANE. We believe this is also the first demonstration of
interoperation of different pilot-job implementations.

  Dynamic Execution \upp\upp}
\label{sec:pilot-model}


% In general, there exist multiple reasons why distributed applications
% have not been able to utilize distributed cyberinfrastructure
% effectively and without immense effort~\cite{dpa_surveypaper}.  At the
% root of the problem is the fact that developing large-scale
% distributed applications is fundamentally a difficult process.

% The range of proposed tools, programming systems and environments is
% bewildering large, making integration, extensibility and
% interoperability difficult. Additionally, 

The uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific
applications has been limited by the availability of extensible,
pervasive and simple-to-use abstractions which are required at
multiple levels – development, deployment and execution stages of
scientific applications.

% Specifically, Pilot-Jobs support the decoupling of workload
% submission from resource assignment; this results in a flexible
% execution model, which in turn enables the distributed scale-out of
% applications on multiple and possibly heterogeneous resources.

The PJ abstraction has been shown to be an effective
abstraction to address specific requirements of distributed scientific
applications. Although they are all functionally equivalent -- they
support the decoupling of workload submission from resource
assignment, it is often impossible to use them interoperably --- most
PJ implementations however, are tied to a specific
infrastructure, or even to compare and contrast them.\alnote{previous sentence
is a potential candidate for improvement.}

In an attempt to provide a common analytical framework using which
most, if not all commonly used pilot-jobs can be understood, we
present the P* model of pilot-abstractions. The P* model is derived
from an analysis of many pilot-job implementations; based upon this analysis, we
first present the common {\it elements} of the P* model, followed by
a description of the properties that must be assigned and that
determine the interaction of these elements and the overall functioning of any
pilot-job that is described by the P* model. Further, we will show that these
elements and interactions can be used to describe a pilot-data model.

% In this section we define the elements of a pilot-job framework. The
% PJ framework provides the abstraction of a container for compute
% tasks that may be dynamically added to it independently from the
% underlying resource pool. It provides a mechanism to decouple compute
% tasks from being hard-coded to a specific resource or at least
% to delay that binding. 

In this section we define the elements of a pilot-job framework. The
PJ framework provides the abstraction of a container for compute
tasks that may be dynamically added to it independently from the
underlying resource pool. It provides a mechanism to decouple compute
tasks from being hard-coded to a specific resource or at least
to delay that binding. Commonly, PJ frameworks consist of the
following elements:

\alnote{I think our elements currently do not sufficiently represent the ability 
to have a dynamic PJ spawned across multiple resources. Added on sentence to the PJ manager. Not sure whether this is enough}
\alnote{Is a WU is assigned to a PJ (colloquial for the whole thing and not a specific PJ) or PJ framework?}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{Pilot-Job (PJ):} The PJ (also referred to as pilot) is the entity
that actually gets submitted and scheduled onto a resource using the local
resource management system that is provided by the resource. The pilot is often
referred to as an agent: It collects local information, manages the resources
allocated to it and exchanges data (such as resource information, states) with
the other elements of the PJ framework. Depending on the context, PJ also refers
to the concept of utilizing a placeholder job to which at a later step the
user's workload is submitted to as well as to the PJ abstraction.

\alnote{Terms: assign -- binding of a wu to a specific pilot (see binding
characteristic); submit -- add a WU to a PJ framework (does not need to get
assigned at this moment)}
\item \textbf{Work Unit (WU):} A work unit is the workload that encapsulates a
self-contained piece of work that is submitted to the PJ framework. The PJ
framework in turn has flexibility in determining when and how-many resources the
WU will receive.

\item \textbf{Scheduling Unit (SU):} SUs are the units of scheduling used inside the PJ framework. They get scheduled and
executed on a resource via the pilot. An SU consists of one or more WUs that are
combined inside the PJ framework. Note that that this can either be a simple
grouping or a smarter aggregation of WUs (e.g. two sets of parameters merged
into one).
  
% are the unit of works that are sent down to \ref{pilot-agent} to be
%   executed.  Sub-jobs/jobs are used to reserve the resources required
%   by a task.
%\jhanote{I changed the US description significantly} 

% \item \textbf{Resource:} A storage/compute resource that has a common
%   entry point (like a queue). Commonly, a resource is accessed by a 
%   LRM. \alnote{move to impl. section} \label{resource}

\item \textbf{Pilot-Manager:} The PJ manager is responsible for coordinating
	  the different components of the framework, i.\,e.\ the pilots, WUs and 
	  SUs. A PJ manager can generally manage multiple pilots.
\end{compactitem}
The application itself is not strictly part of the core P* elements. The term
application generally refers to the upper layer of the stack. The application
utilizes the PJ framework to execute multiple instances of an application kernel
(an ensemble) or alternatively instances of multiple different application
kernels (a workflow). An application kernel is the actual binary that gets run.
To execute an application kernel, an application must define a WU specifying the
application kernel as well as other parameters. This WU can then be assigned to
the PJ framework. Typically this is done via the Pilot-Manager who is then 
responsible for mapping one or more WUs to a SU.

	
As we will see in \S4, the above elements can be mapped to specific
entities in many pilot-jobs in existence and use.

 

% \textbf{Diane Definition of Terms: } The computation consists of many worker
% processes which communicate with one master process (the worker processes do not
% need to share the filesystem nor memory). The ensemble of computation is called
% a run and it consists of many tasks which may be executed in parallel. A task is
% defined as a set of parameters which are produced by the RunMaster (running on a
% master node) and consumed by the WorkerAgent (running on a worker node).
% 
% from 
% 
% DIANE assumes the master-worker computing model (Fig.
% 1). Client sends job parameters to the Planner which partitions
% the job into smaller tasks executed by the Workers. Integrator
% is responsible for merging the results of task execution and
% sending the final job outcome to the Client.


\subsection{Characteristics of P*-Model:\upp\upp}
\label{sec:p_star_elements}

To understand the degrees of freedom that any specific pilot-job
implementation must constraint as well as the functioning of
pilot-jobs implementation, we propose a set of fundamental
properties/characteristics. These characteristics are integral
components of the P* Model, in that they describe the interactions
between the elements, and thus aid in the description of P*
model. 

% Further, these properties are important for the implementation of
% P*.  list several characteristics.

\textbf{Coordination:} describes how the various elements of a PJ framework are
coordinated. % The way the coordination between the different elements
% is handled is required to understand a PJ implementation.
A distributed coordination mechanism, such as master/worker or a set
of distributed software agents, can be utilized. A property for
describing coordination is the point and process of decision making
(e.\,g.\ concerning the binding and scheduling of compute tasks): In
the \textbf{central} model information about available resources (aka
pilots) are collected by a central manager. Decisions are centrally
made by a manager process, which decides which WU is executed on what
resource. In the \textbf{hierarchical} model the decision making
process is divided up into a hierarchy of distributed agents. Each of
them coordinates a defined aspect (e.\,g.\ a certain set of
resources). In the \textbf{decentral} model, control is distributed
among the different components.  PJs with decentralized decision
making often utilize autonomic agents that accepts respectively pull
WUs according to a set of defined policies.



% \begin{compactitem}
% \item \textbf{Decision Making:} 

% \item \textbf{Push versus Pull Model:} We define the terms push and
%   pull based upon the determinism of the binding. If the task is
%   centrally explicitly addressed to a specific pilot, and there is
%   thus no freedom for a pilot to select the task, we speak of a push
%   model. In all other situations, when there is a degree of freedom
%   for the pilots to select a task, we speak of pull. This model is
%   applicable to different aspects of the pilot-job framework (e.g. to
%   task binding, resource binding, resource additions/removals).
%   \alnote{should we move push/pull to communication? It's is also
%     currently references there already}
% 
% \end{compactitem}



    % \item \textbf{Coordination} describes how the various components of 
    % the Pilot-Job framework are coordinated. Possible values for this vector 
    % include data flow, control flow, SPMD (where the control flow is implicit in 
    % all copies of the single program), master-worker (the work done by the 
    % workers is controlled by the master). 
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \item The data flow describes the flow of messages between the 
    %   components of the framework, e.\,g.\ point-to-point messaging or 
    %   publish-subscribe (see Communication).
    %   \item The control flow describes how the various components of the
    %    framework are managed. In the context of pilot-jobs this particularly 
    %    means how the resource on which a sub-job is executed is determined. 
	% \item Sub-Job pull vs. push applies to control and data flow (different 
	% objects that are pushed/pulled)

\textbf{Communication:} describes the mechanisms for data exchange
between the elements of the framework: e.\,g.\ messaging 
(point-to-point, all-to-all, one-to-all, all-to-one, or
group-to-group), stream (potentially unicast or multicast),
publish/subscribe or shared data spaces. 
		
% \textbf{Dynamic Resources:} Dynamic resources describes the ability 
% 	to acquire and release resources at runtime of the pilot-job.
% 	    \alnote{By definition a BJ should be dynamic. After acquiring additional 
% 	    resources, the external coordination is the same for both BJ.}

\textbf{Binding} defines how and at what time the assignment of a WU to a PJ is
done. For example, a WU can be bound to a PJ either before the PJ has in turn
been scheduled (early binding), whereas late binding can occur if the WU is
bound after the PJ has available resources. \jhanote{should this assigned really
be scheduled?} \alnote{refined a bit. But we should talk about binding again.}
Depending upon the type of binding supported, the WU \jhanote{what is workload?
WU?} \alnote{yes} is either specified completely or just independent of a
(specific) resource. \alnote{Question: Is the time of binding independent of
wether the PJ has resources or not? Late binding can also occur if a PJ has
resources.} \jhanote{Sorry, but the question is unclear to me ..lets discuss}
Furthermore, the time of binding influences the point at which the binding
decision is made, e.\,g.\ in the case of early binding, the decision could be
made by the application, while in late binding mode the decision is often made
by the middleware framework.

    %   \begin{itemize}
    %       \item In the traditional early binding approach a job carries
    %        exactly one task which is specified at a time of job submission.
    %       \item Partial binding?
    %       \item Late binding is a scheduling and coordination
    %        method, where work is assigned to a job at runtime rather than at
    %        submission time.
    %       \begin{itemize}
    %           \item At sub-job submission 
    %           \item After sub-job submission
    %       \end{itemize}
    % \end{itemize}

% \jhanote{Difference between mapping and assignment}\alnote{in this
%   case both terms are used very synonymous.}

\textbf{Scheduling:} Scheduling describes the process of mapping a SU to
physical resources via a pilot. Scheduling has a spatial component (which SU is
executed on which pilot?) and a temporal component (at what time?). To optimize
execution, the manager can group WUs into a SU. The different scheduling
decisions that need to be made are representative of multi-level scheduling
decisions that are often required in distributed environments. Commonly a set of
(user-defined) policies (e.g. resource capabilities, data/compute affinities,
etc.) or the implementation of a custom scheduler is supported.

%\begin{itemize}
% \item Multi-level scheduling: In a distributed environment often
%   multiple levels of autonomous schedulers are involved.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The pilot job is schedules using the local RMS or some other
%   Grid (meta)-scheduler.
% \item WU are scheduled to SU on application-level within the
%   pilot-job.
% \end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

	
	
    % \item \textbf{Agent:} Does every pilot-job implementation have an agent? 
    % What are the tasks of an agent? \alnote{Decision for now: agent is not a 
    % fundamental component. Can we cover this in other components, e.g. discuss 
    % multi-level scheduling in task scheduling.}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Wikipedia Definition: may refer to one who acts for, or in the 
    %     place of, another, by authority from him; one entrusted with the 
    %     business of another.
    %     \item Difference between implementation and role of agent
    %     \item Agent explicitly in the model? Or requirements that must be met by 
    %     some component in the model?
    %     \item \textbf{Roles of an agent:}
    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item manages control flow
    %         \item mapping tasks to resources
    %         \item resource management
    %         \item coordination between different components
    %         \item state management of the complete pilot job state
    %         \item discovering local information
    %         \end{itemize}
    %     
	% \item Infrastructure Independence (Supported middleware types and infrastructures)

% \jhanote{I think upto this point, there should not be mention of
%   BigJob -- we should be talking implementation independent, e.g., must
%   not have sub-job and bigjob agent}

illustrates the interactions between the elements of the P* model. A
typical usage mode consists of the following steps: The application
specifies the capabilities of the resources required in a WU
(step 1). During the instantiation of a PJ and the assignment of
resources to the PJ, pilots are queued and started via the local
resource manager (step 1-4). Having initialized the PJ, WUs can be
assigned to it (step 5).

% The pilot is then executed on a
% certain resource (step 5).  

Most PJs utilize a master/worker coordination model, i.\,e.\ the
manager tightly controls the actions of the worker (the
agent). However, it is feasible to include more logic and decision
capabilities into the agent. The application assigns a WU
to the PJ framework in most cases via the Manager component, which is
then responsible for binding the WU to a SU and then scheduling the SU 
to a running pilot.  In
the simplest case one WU corresponds to one SU. The Manager then binds
a SU to specific PJ according to a specified policy or a user provided
scheduler function (step 6). The SU gets executed to a physical
resource on which the pilot is operating (step 7).

%   Dynamic Data..''}


%\subsubsection{Overview}
% The concept of correlated access originates in
% Filecules~\cite{Doraimani:2008:FGS:1383422.1383429}.

% \jhanote{Motivation for PD: We have discussed the importance of DE for
%   compute; there exist similar and important considerations for DE for
%   data. Analogous challenges of DE for data as DE for Compute, e.g.,
%   importance of issues of (late) binding and decision making} 

Dynamic Execution is at least equally important for data-intensive
applications: applications must cope with various challenging issues
e.\,g.\ varying data sources (such as sensors and/or other application
components), fluctuating data rates, optimizations for different
queries, data-/compute co-location etc. Thus, having defined the P*
Model, we propose to extend it with data so as to facilitate an
understanding of DE. This will motivate an analogous abstraction that
we call \emph{Pilot-Data (PD)}. PD provides delayed-binding
\alnote{need to be replaced (or not) once we reached consensus on
  terms} capabilities for data by separating the allocation of
physical storage and application-level data units. Further, it
provides an abstraction for expressing and managing relationships
between Data Unit (DU) as well as DUs and WUs. These relationships are
referred to as \emph{affinities}.  % \jhanote{difficult to use affinity
%   without defining it..}  \alnote{tried to describe affinities a
%   little bit better}

\subsubsection*{Extension of P*-Model Elements}

% The P* model can in many parts be applied to pilot-data.

A Pilot-Data Framework facilitates the late-binding between data units and
physical storage resources, the so called pilot-stores. The elements defined by
P* (in section~\ref{sec:p_star_elements}) can be extended by the following
elements, which are by symmetry, the elements which can be used to define the
Pilot-Data abstraction:
\begin{compactenum}[A.]
\item \textbf{Data Unit (DU):} The base unit of data used by the framework,
  e.\,g.\ a data file or chunk. 
\item \textbf{Pilot-Data (PD):} Allows the logical grouping of DUs
  and the expression of data-data affinities. This collection of files
  can be associated with an extensible set of properties. One of these
  properties is affinity. A PD containing a set of DUs forms the PJ
  equivalent of a WU.
\item \textbf{Pilot-Store (PS):} Binds a pilot-data object to an actual
	  physical resource. A pilot-store object can function as a
	  placeholder object that reserves the space for a pilot-data object. A PS  
	  facilitates the late-binding of data and resource and is equivalent to the 
	  pilot-job.
\item \textbf{Pilot-Data Manager} is analogous to the PJ-Manager responsible for 
  managing DU, PD and PS elements. 
\end{compactenum}

% \jhanote{Are these the elements of Pilot-Data? If so, please make
% connection of above elements to earlier defined elements of P* Model
% explicit, e.g. is Pilot-Data = WU, PS = SU etc. Either way, needs
% integration with the following elements} 
\alnote{I would equate a PS with a pilot-job (the placeholder). SU is
  IMHO more an internal entity not really exposed to the end-user. The
  PD-Manager framework could e.g. use multiple PS to replicate the
  data}

\alnote{please check whether we all can agree on this mapping between PJ and PD or whether we should extend the PD model, e.g. by SU and the PJ model by a WU container?}
In summary, a PD is a logical container that describes the properties of a group
of DUs. A DU correspond to a WU in the PJ model. The PD object provides a
higher level of semantics to the end-user for expressing relationships between
DUs for which there is currently no equivalent in the PJ model. Users of a PJ
must manage WU-level dependencies on application-level. Further, the PD model
does not assume an internal scheduling unit. While there is some value in
introducing a SU to PD, we currently assume that a PD object is
the unit of internal scheduling. Having instantiated a PD, it can be assigned to
a PS. A PS is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of storage, i.\,e.\ it
corresponds to a pilot in the pilot-job model. By associating a PD to a PS the
data is actually moved to the physical location associated with the PS.

\subsubsection*{Extension of P*-Model Characteristics}

% \jhanote{Compress into a paragraph which extends the Characteristics
%   of P*-Model? i.e., Can Data Characteristics, Access Patterns and
%   affinity be demoted from elements, and be put under
%   characteristics?}

While the PD model introduces new elements, the characteristics remain
to a great extent the same. The coordination characteristic describes
how the elements of PD interact; the communication characteristic maps
the identified communication patterns to the PD framework. The
remaining two characteristics can be extended with respect to data:
Binding describes the intelligent grouping and assignment of PDs and
WUs to facilitate an optimal performance. The scheduling particularly
needs to consider affinities, i.\,e.\ user-defined relationships
between PJs and/or PDs, e.\,g.\ data-data affinities exist if
different DU must be present at the same compute element, data-compute
affinities arise if data and compute must be co-located for a
computation, but their current location is different. The decision of
where to place the data and compute is made by the scheduler based on
the defined policies, affinities, available dynamic resource
information.

%sowetatic \alnote{what does this word mean?} \jhanote{it means
%  citatewos :)}

PJ and PD encapsulate cross-cutting properties across data and computation. Both
PJ and PD can be used to express different kind of affinities. The P*
implementation will optimize data- and computing according to the defined
affinities and policies. Both the PJ and PD define similar elements that can be
mapped to each other. Nevertheless, compute and data model sometimes require a
different treatment. With the maturing of both models and implementations, we
expect that both the PJ and PD model converge in the future. In the following,
we discuss further implementation considerations for P*.

% \subsection*{Not sure what to with this yet}
% 
% In summary, Pilot-Data is a set of abstractions for expressing data localities 
% and affinities. Pilot-Data can be used to create groups of file clustered
% together using a quantifiable property, such as affinity ($\alpha$)
% e.g., $\alpha = 1.0$ would imply that files are always stored
% together.
% 
% 
% Pilot-Data provides a set of basic operations on top of these file
% groups, whilst Pilot Store is a container that represents a logical
% group of physical files that share the same affinity. Pilot-Store
% containers can be used to express data-data affinities. The
% abstraction supports basic management tasks (create, delete, update,
% move, list).
% 
% The Pilot-Data abstraction serves the following needs:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Reservation of physical disk space: acquisition of data storage
%   (advanced reservation, place holder)
% \item Virtual destination: dynamically mapping of data to pilot
%   stores.
% \item Runtime environment for $\alpha$ based data
% \item Automatic data partitioning and distribution
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \jhanote{This could be eliminated?} While the application-level
% abstraction enables application developers to model data affinities,
% dependencies etc., the runtime framework will be responsible for
% managing data-compute co-allocations, data-transfers, the dynamic
% expansion of storage pools etc.
% 
% 
% \subsubsection*{PD Impl. Cons.}
% 
% 
% \textbf{Data Characteristics:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Static data refers to data that is infrequently changed and
% does not need to be moved.
%     \item Dynamic data refers to different spatial and temporal
% properties of data:
%     \begin{itemize}
%     	\item Data that is generated or changing at runtime
% (temporal).
%     	\item Data that is in place or needs to be moved (spatial).
% 	\end{itemize}
% 	\item Streaming data
% \end{itemize}
% \textbf{Data Access Patterns: } While the P* is primarily
% concerned with capturing aspects of distributed coordination, this
% elements is extended to include patterns of data access, e.\,g. co-access or gather/scatter that is e.\,g.\ used by MapReduce.

\subsection{Considerations\upp\upp}


%In the following we will discuss how we implement
%use the % developed framework
%to develop the
%TROY -- implementation of the P* model.

% \jhanote{I propose we remove ``framework'' ; if anything it should be
%   Model?}

To implement the P* model, there are additional considerations that must be
taken, e.\,g.\ the exposed end-user abstraction and usage model etc. The API
usage model defines how resources are allocated as well as how WUs are
described, assigned and monitored. Further, non-functional properties such as
fault tolerance and security must be considered. PJ implementations differ in
their support for authorization, authentication and accounting. Commonly grid
technologies e.\,g.\ GSI, VOMS, MyProxy, etc. are often used. Further, it can be
differentiated between single- and multi-user: The former PJ runs under the
identity of a single user and is only able to accept jobs from this user, while
the latter is able to accept jobs from different users.

% Pilot-Jobs can be run on different types of homogeneous and
% heterogeneous resources. Generally, the Local Resource Manager (LRM)
% is the gateway to local resources. This can be e.\,g.\ a PBS/Torque or
% WMS service. HPC resources are specifically designed for high-end
% parallel jobs, while HTC resources are particularly suited for
% independent ensemble of tasks. Different applications require a mix of
% HTC and HPC, e.\,g.\ when running an ensemble of MPI jobs.  Different
% workload characteristics (WU heterogeneities, parallelism, WU
% dependencies, etc.) can be supported by a Pilot-Job, e.\,g.\ via
% special information collector and scheduler capabilities.

TROY is an implementation of the P* model
(section~\ref{sec:pilot-model}) using SAGA (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_pstar_troy}). SAGA~\cite{saga_url,saga_gfd90}
provides a simple, POSIX-style API to the most common grid functions
(e.\,g.\ file, job management and distributed coordination) at a
sufficiently high-level of abstraction so as to be independent of the
diverse and dynamic grid environments. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_pstar_troy} TROY is based on % \jhanote{need a
%   better expression. ``located on top'' is too colloquial}
% \alnote{changed, maybe someone has a more fancy word?} 
the SAGA API and runtime environment, which is utilized for job
management, data transfer and distributed coordination. The TROY API
maintains the SAGA {\it Look \& Feel} and was designed to be similar
to SAGA in appearance % \jhanote{isn't appearance covered in
%   look-and-feel?}  \alnote{Look \& Feel incl. the appearance, but also
%   some non-functional classes such as context} \jhanote{can we then
%   use descriptive/long-form: ``appearance and non-functional
%   classes''}
and philosophy: it re-uses many of the well defined (and standardized)
semantics and syntax of the File, Job and Advert API. Further, we
aimed for a minimally, complete API exposing the least details
necessary.

TROY supports different usage modes i) it provides stand-alone PJ
functionalities, ii) it provides a unified API to various PJ
implementations (e.\,g.\ Condor Glide-In and DIANE) and iii) enables
the concurrent usage of multiple PJ implementations. Further, we show
in section~\ref{sec:bigdata} how TROY is extended to support dynamic
data and affinity-based scheduling.

\alnote{TODO: refine relationship between TROY, PJ and BigJob}
The TROY framework consists of the API package, the runtime
environment and different PJ implementations referred to as
BigJob. The TROY API is based on the artifacts defined by the P* model
%\jhanote{Is framework here P* ?}\alnote{yes}
defined in section~\ref{sec:pilot-model}. It defines two description
classes that extend the known SAGA Job Description, the PJ description
and the WU description. A TROY manager represents a pool of
resources. Resources can be added by submitting a pilot-job
description to the TROY manager using the \texttt{add\_resource()}
method. Subsequently, WU can be assigned to the TROY manager. At
runtime resources can be added and removed at any time.  The TROY API
is available at~\cite{troy_api}.

    % 	\end{figure}


% General overview of BJ implementations & P* model
The BigJob implementations are plugged into the TROY runtime environment via a
thin adaptor layer (see Figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}).
BigJob-SAGA~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} is a implementation of TROY built on
top of the SAGA API. BJ-SAGA utilizes a master/worker coordination model:
The BigJob Manager is responsible for the orchestration and scheduling of the
PJs represented by the BigJob Agent. For submission of the pilots, BigJob-SAGA
relies on the SAGA Job API and thus, can be used in conjunction with different
SAGA adaptors, e.\,g.\ the Globus, PBS, Amazon Web Service and local adaptor.
The SAGA Advert Service and API are used for communication between manager and
agent. The Advert Service exposes a shared data space that can be accessed by
the manager and agent, which follow a push/pull communication pattern, i.\,e.\
the manager pushes a SU to the Adverts Service while the agents periodically
pull for new data. Results and state updates are pushed back from the agent to
the manager in the same way. The binding between WU and SU \& PJ takes places at
submission (early binding). Currently, only a simple binding scheme exists,
i.\,e.\ each WU (a task) is mapped to a single SU (a so called sub-job). For
scheduling a simple FIFO scheduler is used.

In addition to the BigJob-SAGA various other BigJob
implementations exist, e.\,g. there are specific BJ flavors for cloud
resources as Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure that are capable of
managing set of VMs as well as as a BJ with a Condor Glide-In based
backend. 
% All core BJ are confined to a single resource and don't allow
% neither elasticity nor late binding.

%paragraph on dynamic capabilities

In many scenarios it is beneficial to utilize multiple resources, e.\,g.\ to
accelerate the time-to-completion or to provide resilience to resource failures
and/or unexpected delays. The TROY API allows for dynamic resource
additions/removals as well as late binding. The support of this feature depends
on the backend used. To support this feature on top of various BigJob
implementations that are by default restricted to single resource use (e.\,g.\
BJ-SAGA), the concept of a BigJob pool is introduced. A BigJob pool consists of
multiple BJs. Each BigJob manages a particular resources. An extensible
scheduler is used for dispatching WUs to one of the BJs of the pool (late
binding). For this purpose an extensible scheduler is used. By default a FIFO
and an affinity-aware scheduler are provided. Various other backends support
resource elasticity natively, e.\,g.\ DIANE and Condor.

% For this purpose, the dynamic BigJob provides an introspection API
% that applications can utilize to query the manager for a list of
% current resources.

%  Thus, BigJob-DIANE provides dynamic
% capabilities out-of-the-box, the traditional BigJob
% implementation~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} utilizes two layers: the
% \emph{Core BigJob} and the so called \emph{BigJob Pool} layer. Core BigJobs are
% confined to a single resource and represented by a single master process
% (i.\,e.\ a single BigJob Manager). Generally, Core BigJobs are used to
% encapsulate resource specifics, e.\,g.\ for a certain type of infrastructure
% (Condor, Cloud, etc.). A BigJob Pool manages multiple Core BigJobs.

% Aspects that need to be addressed:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Big-Job Agent: capacity (physical size) is a property of an agent. 
% 	cardinality: how many sub-jobs can be managed by an agent?
% 	\item Sub-Job Agent: Agent assignment should be separated from resource 
% 	assignment. Agent has the freedom to assign tasks to sub-job in any way 
% 	it want. Agent can do local decisions.    
%   \item Would it make sense to use the ``internal'' versus
%     ``external'' coordination concept to distinguish sub-job
%     versus big-job agent
% \end{itemize}





% Dynamic BigJob provides the ability to dynamically add and remove resources to a 
% big-job. The API consists of two parts, the resource management and the resource 
% introspection part:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{add\_resource()}: New resources are added by starting a new
%     big-job.There are various flavors of this method:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \texttt{add\_resource(re\-sour\-ce\_dic\-tionary)}: Start another big-job on the resource defined in the \texttt{resource\_dictionary}.
%         \item \texttt{add\_resource(affinity, number\_cores)}: Add another big-job to the specified affinity group.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{remove\_resource(bigjob)}: Removes the big-job from the
%     resources.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% Higher-level wrappers that encapsulate e.\,g.\ the specific resource
% descriptions can be implemented. Further, to implement this dynamic resource
% capabilities it is necessary to provide different dynamic resource introspection
% in the dynamic big-job layer:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \texttt{get\_resources()}: returns a list of managed big-job objects.
%      Each big-job object can be queried for it's allocated resources (number 
%      nodes, number cores).
% \end{itemize}


% It uses SAGA BigJob approach to start multiple BigJobs agents 
% whether on a single resource or on multiple resources. And 
% these agents are responsible for pulling the tasks from advert 
% service and run the possible subjobs concurrently or in generations.

% \jhanote{The rationale behind dynamic BJ is that for the same
%   application scenario different BJ with different
%   properties/characteristics may be required. Thus dynamic BJ maybe
%   comprised of either homogeneous or heterogeneous atomic BJs}
% \alnote{did one pass... still not perfect}

% \jhanote{I propose the next 3 subsections -- bigjob-cloud, bigjob-aws
%   and bigjob-azure, be removed}\alnote{gone, there was no news anyhow}

% \subsubsection{BigJob for Cloud Computing}
% 
% \jhanote{Once again -- why do differences in execution details between
%   grids and clouds result in the need for different atomic BJs needs
%   to be explained. Must emphasis that the API remains the same.}
% 
% At the execution level, clouds differ from Clusters/Grids in at least a couple
% of different ways. In cloud environments, user-level jobs are not typically
% exposed to a scheduling system; a user-level job consists of requesting the
% instantiation of a virtual machine (VM). Virtual machines are either assigned to
% the user or not (this is an important attribute that provides the illusion of
% infinite resources). The assignment of job to a VM must be done by the user (or
% a middleware layer as BigJob). In contrast, user-level jobs on grids and 
% clusters are exposed to a scheduling system and are
% assigned to execute at a later stage. Also a description of a grid job typically
% contains an explicit description of the workload; in contrast for Clouds a user
% level job usually contains the container (description of the resource
% requested), but does not necessarily include the workload. In other words, the
% physical resources are not provisioned to the workload but are provisioned to
% the container.  Interestingly, at this level of formulation, pilot-jobs attempt 
% to provide a similar model of resource provisioning as clouds natively offer. 
% 
% \subsubsection{BigJob and SAGA AWS Adaptor}
% 
% BigJob provides support for various cloud computing environment. The SAGA BigJob
% implementation can be used in conjunction with the AWS adaptor for SAGA to run
% on EC2-based cloud infrastructures, such as FutureGrid. However, there are some 
% limitations mainly caused by the restrictions of SAGA/AWS adaptor for the SAGA 
% Job package. The SAGA job service object e.\,g.\ does not provide a mean to 
% specify a set of resources. Using the AWS adaptor it is only possible to utilize 
% a single VM instance, which must be configured prior to the run in a 
% configuration file. If multiple VMs are required, the dynamic BigJob 
% implementation must be used. In this case however, it is still not possible to 
% run MPI jobs across multiple VMs. 
% \smnote {why is it not possible to run MPI jobs across Multiple VM's?} \alnote{MPI jobs are (unless you do something outside of BJ) constraint to run

% 
% \subsubsection{BigJob Cloud \& BigJob Azure}
% 
% To address this limitation, BigJob-Cloud~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} was
% developed. BigJob-Cloud provides an implementation of the BigJob API, which is
% completely independent from the SAGA (and thus, the SAGA AWS adaptor). It
% directly utilizes the Amazon tools to access cloud resources. It can manage
% cluster of VM; for this purpose BigJob provides a rich interface for describing
% cloud resources. For this purpose a Python dictionary is used (see
% section~\ref{sec:api}). The VMs can be managed centrally by the BigJob manager:
% All VMs have a public IP and there is no need to interface with a local resource
% manager (SAGA BigJob e.\,g.\ evaluates the \texttt{\$PBS\_NODEFILE} to obtain a
% list of resources). Thus, it is not necessary to deploy an agent on the VM - all
% necessary metadata can be obtained from the AWS backend. Job are spawned via
% SSH.
% 
% % \begin{itemize}
% %   \item ManyJob is required to manage the set of VMs. The BigJob-Cloud can manage a set of VMs without the need of ManyJob.
% %   \item Bigjob uses advert server for communication between BigJob-agent and BigJob whereas BigJob-Cloud does not use an advert server.
% %   \item Bigjob-cloud does not require SAGA-AWS adaptors as opposed to requirement in original Bigjob. 
% % \end{itemize} 
% 
% 
% BigJob-Azure~\cite{10.1109/CloudCom.2010.85} utilizes a similar approach as
% BigJob-Cloud. It utilizes the Azure REST interface to startup VM Worker Roles.
% However, since Azure does not support SSH access it is necessary to utilize an
% agent-based approach. For communication between the agent and the manager the
% Azure Storage is used.
% 
% \msnote{If BigJob is the atomic unit, it should not differ per
%   backend}\alnote{That's mainly a restriction of the job package which
%   does not really map to AWS. There is no common way in the job
%   package to specify the \# of resources that suppose to be
%   used. Thus, this limitation}


\subsection{BigData: Pilot-Data for TROY\upp\upp}
\label{sec:bigdata}
% \jhanote{theory goes upfront; implementation and architecture stays
%   here} \alnote{ok}

BigData is the SAGA-based implementation of the Pilot-Data abstraction.
Figure~\ref{fig:pilot-data-architecture} gives an overview of the
architecture. The system consists of two components: the PD manager and
the agents deployed on the physical resources. The coordination 
scheme used is master/worker with some intelligence that is located de-centrally at 
the BD agent. As communication mechanism the SAGA Advert Service is used.


The PD manager is responsible for 1) meta-data management, i.\,e.\ it keeps
track of the pilot stores that a pilot data object is associated with, 2) it
schedules data movements and data replications taking into account the
application requirements defined via affinities and 3) for managing data
movements. The PD scheduler particularly supports affinity-aware scheduling.
Similar to BigJob, an agent on each resource is used to manage the physical
storage on a resource. Both PJ and PD are tightly integrated to efficiently support the compute- and data-related aspects of dynamic execution. 


% For this purpose, the PD and PJ manager work closely together to manage compute-/data-affinities for applications. 
% 
% For this purpose the PJ scheduler was
% extended to support affinities, i.\,e.\ when scheduling WU it considers
% dependencies toward PDs.


% \jhanote{Need to explain/describe architecture of BigData? using the
%   terminology of Section II and P*-Model}

% \begin{figure}[htbp]
%     \centering
%         \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/pilot-data-manager.pdf}
%     \caption{\textbf{BigData Architecture:} The PD-Manager is exposing the 
% 	TROY Pilot-Data API. Application can create group of files and assign file
% 	to storage. The PD manager tracks files and physical locations in the data 
% 	catalog. The data scheduler optimizes the co-locations of files and compute 
% 	(in conjunction with BJ). The transfer manager initiates and monitors the 
% 	actual data movements. \upp\upp}
%     \label{fig:pilot-data-architecture}
% \end{figure}



% A possible implementation option would be the 
% integration of the PD and BigJob agent, which is particularly useful for 
% managing data-/compute-affinities.

% A core part of the data manager is the data scheduler. The scheduler aims for a
% optimum of data and compute locality for an applications: it selects the storage
% and compute elements for a WU submitted. For this purpose the PJ scheduler was
% extended to support affinities, i.\,e.\ when scheduling WU it considers
% dependencies toward PDs. The manager is then responsible for managing necessary
% file transfer, the pre-fetching of files if applicable, as well as the executing
% the actual WU. For file-transfer management BigData utilizes SAGA and thus, is
% infrastructure independent. It supports all underlying SAGA adaptors (SSHFS,
% GridFTP) and future adaptors such as Globus Online.



% \subsubsection{BigJob and BigData Integration}
% 
% In particular for data-intensive applications data locality is an important
% concern. Different types of affinity, e.\,g.\ data-data or data-compute, exists.
% Dynamic BigJob provides support for data-compute affinities. Each resource
% (i.\,e.\ each big-job) can be assigned to a certain affinity. The affinity-aware
% scheduler then ensures that sub-jobs that demand a certain affinity are only
% executed on resources that fulfill this constraint.

% \jhanote{I think there was agreement to go with Mode II}

As more applications take advantage of dynamic execution, the Pilot-Job concept
has grown in popularity and has been extensively researched and implemented for
different usage scenarios and infrastructure. There is a variety of PJ
implementations: Condor Glide-In~\cite{condor-g}, SWIFT~\cite{Wilde2011},
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910}, DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049},
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062041}, ToPoS~\cite{topos},
Nimrod/G~\cite{10.1109/HPC.2000.846563}, Falkon~\cite{1362680} and
MyCluster~\cite{1652061} to name a few. The aim of this section is to show that
our P* Model can be used to explain/understand some of these PJ implementations,
in particular DIANE as well as Condor Glide-In and Swift.
Table~\ref{table:bigjob-saga-diane} shows how the elements P* model can be
mapped to these frameworks. Table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison} compares the
characteristics of the four PJ implementations.


% In addition to the three Pilot-Job framework discussed in this section, various

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item MyCluster~\cite{1652061} enables the 
% 	creation of a Condor, PBS or SGE clusters on-demand.

\subsection{DIANE\upp\upp}

% Coordination and Communication
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} is a task coordination framework, which was
originally designed for implementing master/worker applications, but also
provides PJ functionality for job-style executions. DIANE utilizes a single
hierarchy of worker agents as well as a PJ manager referred to as
\texttt{RunMaster}. Further, there is ongoing work on a multi-master extensions.
For the spawning of PJs a separate script, the so-called submitter script, is
required. For the access to the physical resources the GANGA 
framework~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0902-2685} can be used. GANGA
provides a unified interface for job submissions to various resource types,
e.\,g.\ EGI resources or TG resources via a SAGA backend. Once the worker agents
are started they register themselves at the RunMaster. In contrast to BJ-SAGA, a
worker agent generally manages only a single core and thus, by default is not
able to run parallel applications (e.\,g.\ based on MPI). In contrast to
BJ-SAGA, DIANE worker agents possess less local autonomy and are directly
controlled by the master. BJ-SAGA delegates the management of the local
resources from the BJ manager to the BJ agent. The agent collects information
about local resources and manages the allocation of these resources locally. For
communication between the RunMaster and worker agents point-to-point messaging
based on CORBA (omniORB) is used. CORBA is also used for file staging, a feature
currently not fully supported by BJ-SAGA.

% Binding 
DIANE is primarily designed with respect to HTC environments (such as
EGI~\cite{egi}), i.\,e.\ one PJ consists of a single worker agent with the size
of 1 core. BJ-SAGA in contrast is designed for HPC systems such as TG, where a
job usually allocates multiple nodes and cores. To address this issue a
so-called multinode submitter script can be used: the scripts starts a defined
number of worker agents on a certain resource. However, WUs will be constrained
to the specific number of cores managed by a worker agent. A flexible allocation
of resource chunks as with BJ-SAGA is not possible. By default a WU is mapped to
a SU; application can however implement smarter allocation schemes, e.\,g.\ the
clustering of multiple WUs into a SU.

%Scheduling
DIANE includes a simple capability matcher and FIFO-based task scheduler.
Plugins for other workloads, e.\,g.\ DAGs or for data-intensive
application, exists or are under development. The framework is extensible:
applications can implement a custom application-level scheduler.


%Other impl. related issues: FT and security
DIANE is as BJ-SAGA a single-user PJ, i.\,e.\ each PJ is executed with the
privileges of the respective user. Also, only WUs of this respective user can be
executed by DIANE. For communication, DIANE currently relies CORBA/TCP. The 
implementation of GSI on TCP-level is possible, but currently not yet 
implemented. Further, DIANE supports fault tolerance: basic error detection and propagation mechanisms are in place. Further, an automatic re-execution of WUs is possible.


\subsection{Condor Glide-In\upp\upp}

Condor GlideIn pioneered the Pilot-Job concept~\cite{condor-g}. The pilot-job is
actually represented by a complete Condor pool that is started using the Globus
GRAM service of a resource (this feature is referred to as Condor Glide-In);
subsequently jobs can be submitted to this Glide-In pool using the standard
Condor tools and APIs. Condor utilizes a master/worker coordination model. The
PJ manager is referred to as the Condor Central Manager. The functionality of
the Central Manager is provided by several daemons: the conder\_master that is
generally responsible for managing all daemons on a machine, the
conder\_collector which collects resource information, the conder\_negotiator
that does the matchmaking and the condor\_schedd that is responsible for
managing the binding and scheduling process. Condor generally does not
differentiate between workload, i.\,e.\ WU, and schedulable entity, i.\,e.\ SU.
Both entities are referred to as job. However, it supports late binding,
i.\,e.\ resources a job is submitted to must generally not be available at
submission time. The scheduler matches the capabilities required by a WU to the
available resources. This process is referred to as matchmaking. Further, a
priority-based scheduler is used. For communication between the identified
elements Condor utilizes point-to-point messaging using a binary protocol on top
of TCP.

Different fault tolerance mechanisms, such as automatic retries, are supported.
Further, Condor supports different security schemes: for authentication it
integrates both with local account management systems (such as Kerberos) as well
as grid authentication systems such as GIS. Communication traffic can be
encrypted.



\subsection{SWIFT-Coaster\upp\upp}

SWIFT~\cite{Wilde2011} relies on its scripting language to describe abstract
workflows and computations. The language provides among many things capabilities
for executing external application as well as the implicit management of data
flows between application tasks. For this purpose, SWIFT formalizes the way that
applications can define data-dependencies. Using so called mappers dependencies
can be easily extended to files or groups of files. The runtime environment
handles the allocation of resources and the spawning of the compute tasks. Both
data- and execution management capabilities are provided via abstract
interfaces. SWIFT supports e.\,g.\ Globus, Condor and PBS resources. The pool of
resources that is used for an application is statically defined in a
configuration file. While this configuration file can refer to highly dynamic
resources (such as OSG resources), there is no possibility to manage this
resource pool programmatically. By default a 1:1 mapping for WU and jobs is
used. However, SWIFT supports the clustering of WUs into a large SU as
well as PJs for which the term Coaster~\cite{coasters} is used. Coaster
relies on a master/worker coordination model; communication is implemented using
GSI-secured TCP sockets.

%   pilot-job.  Just to keep life interesting, they call it head-job and

\section{Implementations and Results\upp\upp}

% In this section we discuss the TROY API. Further, (i) we show that the TROY API
% can be used to marshal DIANE stand-alone as well as (ii) that the TROY API can
% be used stand alone with both BigJob and DIANE concurrently. 

\jhanote{MS: The experiment section needs tighter and more focussed
  writing in general}

In these experiments we execute BFAST~\cite{bfast2009} - a genome
sequencing application. To manage the workflow, we use the
DARE~\cite{dare-tg11} framework, which in turn uses TROY.  We utilize
the LONI~\cite{loni}  resource Oliver and a total of 16 cores
distributed across four nodes.

In these experiments, we use two BigJob implementations BJ-SAGA and
BJ-DIANE. We define eight WUs that run BFAST. The WUs are run on three
different backends: (i) BJ-SAGA only, (ii) BJ-DIANE only and (iii)
both BJ-SAGA and BJ-DIANE. In case (iii) on each backend four WUs are
executed.

For each scenarios respectively two PJ descriptions are prepared. Depending on
the specified backend the respective BJ implementation is used for dispatching
the actual pilots. While BJ-SAGA utilizes one BJ agent on the resource, BJ-DIANE
requires the spawning of one worker agent per WU that must be executed in
parallel. \jhanote{What is executed in parallel to what?} \smnote{In the
experiments we run all the BFAST WUs (8) concurrently. To run these 8 WUs
concurrently with BJ-DIANE implementation we have to start 8 different DIANE
agents since a DIANE agent can run only one task at a time}The TROY API marshals
these differences, i.\,e.\ while the API remains the same for both backends,
the different semantics in the PJ implementation are handled by the TROY 
backend.
\jhanote{What are we trying to say here?  Is it that although the API
  is similar, semantics of implementation and execution remain
  different, and that TROY backend handles them?}\alnote{well said}

Each BFAST instance requires two cores; a total of eight WUs
allocating two cores each is specified and assigned to TROY. Each WU
is associated with a set of input files. After assignment of the WU to
the PJ manager, the TROY runtime takes care of binding and scheduling
the WUs to the pilots. The application can monitor the state of the
PJs and WUs using the TROY API.


% To perform the above experiments we built an application \smnote{this
% application is DARE. do we need mention it here?} using TROY API to submit Bfast
% WU's with different input files to different backend implementations. The WU's
% are completely handled and submitted to different backends by TROY and the
% co-ordination of WU's was made simple for the application. Further, applications
% can also continuously monitor status of remote agents and UOWs.

% Further, it shows that both PJ implementations can be used
% concurrently. This is particularly useful if the time-to-completion can be
% reduced in cases where resources on another infrastructure are available.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{perf/perf-bfast-bj.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Performance TROY with BJ-SAGA and BJ-DIANE:} Running BFAST 
	on a 4 node cluster with a total of 16 cores. The time-to-completion for 
	BJ-DIANE is higher than for BJ-SAGA mainly due to the higher startup 
	time required and some light runtime overhead caused by the additional 
	agents required on the resource.\upp \upp}
	\label{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj}
\end{figure}



Figure~\ref{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj} shows the result of the
experiment. The time-to-completion for BJ-DIANE is about 207\,sec
longer than for BJ-SAGA. The main contributor for this increased
runtime is the deployment time required for DIANE. In a multi-node
setup multiple work agents must be used (8 in this case).  For each
worker agent DIANE must be downloaded, installed and started
separately. In total this requires about 178\,sec. Further, each DIANE
worker agent is queued as a separate job at the local resource manager
-- this contributes the the higher deviation in the measured
runtimes. While BJ-SAGA requires a pre-run installation on each site,
it only shows a startup time of 28\,sec. Additionally, we also
observed a runtime overhead of about 17\,sec for the BJ-DIANE
scenario. This overhead is likely caused by the additional agents
required.

% % In the case of BJ-DIANE backend Multinode submitter was not used/not % yet. As
% a result it submits job request's for each node separately and there % also some
% delay between actual launch and startup time of UOW. Further, DIANE % was
% installed separately for every agent/node requested.

Finally scenario iii) demonstrates that two BJ implementations
(BJ-SAGA and BJ-DIANE) can be utilized concurrently using the TROY
API. The performance in this scenario is slightly better than in the
DIANE only case, mainly due to the fact that only four DIANE worker
agents need to be started. Also, only half of the WUs are executed on
a DIANE node and thus, show a longer runtime. While there are some
limitations in the current BJ-DIANE implementation, the aim of this
experiment is to emphasizes the possibilities that the TROY API
provides to dynamic applications. TROY enables applications to utilize
a dynamic resource pool consisting of resources of different
infrastructures, e.\,g.\ EGI and TG/XD resources. Dynamic applications
can utilize the elasticity of the TROY resource pool e.\,g.\ to
improve the time-to-completion and/or to scale the accuracy of their
computations.


% Further, TROY hides many of the complications with
% various pilot jobs like multiple node backend agents, how WU's distribution to
% various backends. Thus, this enables users of this API to concentrate more on
% designing their applications instead worrying about the various configurations
% of the pilot jobs.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work\upp\upp}

% The P* model was used to demonstrate

We established PJ and PD as abstractions for supporting dynamic
execution by decoupling workload and resource
assignment/scheduling. The P* model provides a common framework for
describing and characterizing Pilot-abstractions.  We validate the P*
model by demonstrating that the most widely used PJ implementations,
viz., DIANE, Condor Glide-In and SWIFT can be compared, contrasted and
analyzed using this framework, i.\,e.\ the architecture and the
communication and coordination schemes.  TROY is an implementation of
the P* model that captures the commonalities between the different PJ
implementations via a common API.

% they share different important properties with respect to the commonly
% used communication and coordination schemes.

In the future, we will align the TROY API with the emerging SAGA
Resource Management API~\cite{saga_rm}. We will further refine the
TROY API, e.\,g.\ by generically supporting different security models
via a context API (similar to the SAGA Context API). Further, we will
investigate autonomic resource management strategies, e.\,g.\ by
deploying more decentral decision logic into the agents of our
framework.
