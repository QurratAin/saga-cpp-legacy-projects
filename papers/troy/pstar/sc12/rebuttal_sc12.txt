Section V-B: the text references figure elements using a terminology which
differs from the one used for figure axis labels: C1, C2, HTC, ... while the
figure axis are labelled BigJob/XSEDE, DIANE/EGI, XSEDE:Trestles/FG, etc. This
is confusing for the reader. Please provide a common naming convention.

The strength of the paper is that it attacks an important problem: there is a
proliferation of pilot frameworks, each working in essentially the same way,
so providing a unifying model and underpinnings of interoperability can
potentially simplify moving between infrastructures using different
implementations.

A significant weakness of the paper is that the P* model is not explained
well. The authors see the pilot jobs as primarily facilitating mapping tasks
onto heterogeneous resource pools. In practice though, pilot frameworks seem
to be popular primarily because they offer some control over resource
provisioning in a job/batch scheduler dominated world (i.e., a pilot gilde-in
is used to obtain a resource lease onto which an application can then submit
jobs, further, infrastructures like MyCluster have been used to configure the
resource). This resource versus job provisioning aspect has not been
articulated enough; for example, the SUs are in practice resource slots. Later
in the paper, there is talk of “the process of mapping a SU to resources via a
Pilot” and “potential” multiple layers of scheduling (there are always at
least two in a pilot framework). A clearer model and explanation here would
significantly improve the paper. Also, in the evaluation, it would be more
interesting to see more fine-grained performance results to get a better feel
for the potential performance issues of pilot frameworks. Is the API itself
introducing any overhead? What are the trade-offs for the user for choosing to
submit to two several different pilot-based systems instead of one?


"This resource versus job provisioning aspect has not been articulated enough"
Once you have control over the resource you don't have to worry about the job

It's not about jobs anymore, but about tasks...
=> will be make it clearer. There is scope for improvements


Performance:
=>More-fine grained performance... => can be rebuttled
=>API overhead is in the text

#3
What are research deductions from work.
=> this is a system paper and this is the validation of a concept
=> MR paper shows how genome sequencing challenge has been solved

ideas are old and not very exciting
=> quote 1. reviewer

What do experiments show?
=> they validate the conceptual model
=> PD specifics?

Where do clouds fit in?
=> clouds do fit in are a specific type of resource with certain properties (affinities)

#4

Based system like Condor-G/Glide-in has a scheduling feature by, for example, 
match-making. How can it be expressed by the proposed pilot job framework? 
Relation of existing systems that provide the same functionality as the 
proposed framework is not clear.

=> Affinity is going to be the basis for advanced scheduling capability
=> see table
