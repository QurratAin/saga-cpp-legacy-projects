\section{Introduction and Overview} 

The seamless uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific
applications has been limited by the availability of extensible,
pervasive and simple-to-use abstractions at multiple levels -- at
development, deployment and execution stages of scientific
applications~\cite{dpagrid2009}.  Even where meaningful abstractions
exist, the challenges of providing them in an extensible, reliable and
scalable manner so as to support multiple applications and are
usable on different infrastructures are formidable.  The lack of
appropriate implementations has in fact resulted in ``one-off''
solutions that address challenges in a highly customized manner.
Tools and implementations are often highly dependent on and tuned to a
specific execution environment, further impacting portability,
reusability and extensibility.  Semantic and interface incompatibility
are certainly barriers, but so is the lack of a common architecture
and conceptual framework upon which to develop similar tools a
barrier.

%reinforces the fragmentation~\cite{dpa_surveypaper}.
% there remains, scope for improvement in both the range and number of
% supported abstractions and the type of infrastructure over which such
% abstractions are made available.

This general state of affairs also captures the specific state of the
abstractions provided by {\it \pilotjobs (PJ)}. \pilotjobs have been
one of the most successful abstractions in distributed
computing. Distributed cyber/e-infrastructure is by definition
comprised of a set of resources that is fluctuating -- growing,
shrinking, changing in load and capability (in contrast to a static
resource utilization model of traditional parallel
and cluster computing systems).  The ability to utilize a dynamic resource
pool is thus an important attribute of any application that needs to
utilize distributed cyberinfrastructure (DCI) efficiently. As a
consequence of providing a simple approach for decoupling workload
management and resource assignment/scheduling, PJ provide an
effective abstraction for dynamic execution and resource utilization in
a distributed context.


The fundamental reason for the success of the PJ abstraction is that
PJ liberate applications/users from the challenging requirement of
mapping specific tasks onto explicit heterogeneous and dynamic
resource pools.  PJ also thus shields application from having to
load-balance tasks across such resources.  The \pilotjob abstraction
is also a promising route to address specific requirements of
distributed scientific applications, such as coupled-execution and
application-level scheduling~\cite{ko-efficient,DBLP:conf/hpdc/KimHMAJ10}.


A variety of PJ frameworks have emerged:
Condor-G/ Glide-in~\cite{condor-g}, Swift~\cite{Wilde2011},
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910}, DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049},
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062041}, ToPoS~\cite{topos},
Nimrod/G~\cite{10.1109/HPC.2000.846563}, Falkon~\cite{1362680} and
MyCluster~\cite{1652061} to name a few. Although they are all, for the
most parts, functionally equivalent -- they support the decoupling of
workload submission from resource assignment -- it is often impossible
to use them interoperably or even just to compare them functionally or
qualitatively.  The situation is reminiscent of the proliferation of
functionally similar yet incompatible workflow systems, where in spite
of significant a posteriori effort on workflow system extensibility
and interoperability (thus providing post-facto justification of its
needs), these objectives remains difficult if not infeasible.

% In \S{III} we introduce TROY -- A Tiered Resource OverlaY -- as an
% implementation of the P* Model. TROY provides an API for the P* Model
% and exposes the semantics of PJ frameworks; TROY also has a runtime
% system that enables it to work with different middleware on
% heterogeneous distributed platforms.

% Implementations of PJ frameworks, such as BigJob and DIANE, are
% integrated into TROY via an adaptor mechanism; we posit that the TROY
% framework and API can be used for most, if not all PJ frameworks.

% The P* Model captures the essence of most, if not all existing PJ
% frameworks.

We present the P* Model in \S\ref{sec:pilot-model}. Our objective is to
provide a minimal, but complete model -- hence referred to as P* Model, for
\pilot abstractions. We also investigate generalizations to the base P* Model.
A natural and logical extension of the P* Model arises from the need to extend
it to include data in addition to computational tasks. This leads to analogous
abstraction to the \pilotjob: the \emph{\pilotdata (PD)} abstraction. The
potentially consistent treatment of data and compute suggests symmetrical
compute and data elements in the model; thus we refer to this model as the P*
Model ("P-star").

The P* Model provides a conceptual basis to compare and contrast different PJ
frameworks -- which to the best of our knowledge is the first such attempt. In
\S\ref{sec:pilot-job-frameworks} we validate this claim by analyzing
well-known PJ frameworks (BigJob, Condor-G/Glide-in, DIANE) using the P*
Model. \S\ref{sec:pilot-api} of this paper motivates and describes the
Pilot-API; we discuss how existing and widely used \pilotjob frameworks, can
be used through the Pilot-API. \S\ref{sec:exp_res} describes the experiments
and performance measurements used to characterize the workings of the
Pilot-API and to demonstrate interoperability across middleware, platform and
different PJ frameworks. To further substantiate the impact of P*, we will
demonstrate interoperability between different PJ frameworks -- BigJob and
DIANE. We believe this is also the first demonstration of concurrent
interoperation of different \pilotjob implementations. Performance advantages
arising from the ability to distribute part of a data-intensive workload are
discussed; interoperable capabilities increase flexibility in resource
selection and optimization.

% After validating the P* Model -- as measured by extensibility and
% interoperability -- 


%Before discussing the P* Model, 

It is worth noting that \pilotjobs are used on every major
national and international DCI, including NSF/XSEDE,
NSF/DOE Open Science Grid, EU EGI and others, to support hundreds and
thousands of tasks daily, thus we believe the impact and validation of
this paper lies in its ability to not only influence but also bridge
the theory and practice of \pilotjobs, and thus multiple domains of
science dependent on distributed cyberinfrastructure.

\section{The P* Model of Pilot-\\Abstractions}
\label{sec:pilot-model}


To provide a common analytical framework to understand the most
commonly used \pilotjobs, we present the P* Model of
pilot-abstractions. The P* model is derived from an analysis of many
\pilotjob implementations; based upon this analysis, we first present
the common {\it elements} of the P* Model, followed by a description
of the {\it characteristics} that determine the interaction of these
elements and the overall functioning of a \pilotjob framework that is
consistent with the P* Model.

%All pilot-job frameworks (whether they adhere rigorously to the P*
%model or not), have these {\it elements}, but differ in {\it
%  characteristics}.
%specific attributes \alnote{What would be an attribute in this
%  context?} and

% Further, we will show that
% these elements and interactions can be used to describe a pilot-data
% model.
 
Before we proceed to discuss the P* Model, it is important to
emphasize that there exist a plethora of terms --- abstraction, model,
framework, and implementation, that are overloaded and overlapping,
and often even used inconsistently in the literature; thus we
establish their context and usage in this paper.

\emph{Terms and Usage:} The \emph{ abstraction} of a \pilotjob
generalizes the reoccurring concept of utilizing a placeholder job as a
container for a set of compute tasks; instances of that placeholder
job are commonly referred to as \emph{\pilotjobs} or
\emph{pilots}. The P* \emph{model} provides a % specific,
comprehensive description of \pilotjob abstractions based on a set of
identified elements and their interactions. The P* Model can be used
as a {\it conceptual model}, for analyzing different implementations
of the \pilotjob abstraction. The \emph{Pilot-API} exposes a sub-set
of the P* elements and characteristics to applications. 
It is important to distinguish P* which provides a conceptual (abstract) model 
from an implementation of the P* Model. A \emph{\pilotjob framework} refers to a 
specific instance of a \pilotjob implementation and associated infrastructure 
that provides the complete \pilotjob functionality (e.\,g.\ Condor-G/Glide-in and
DIANE). 

%\alnote{The next sentence is not really helpful - we also not really
%  using the term PJ system in the rest of the paper:} The term
%"pilot-job system" could have been used as well, but past experience
%shows that even with ``system'', there remains scope for confusion
%between the pilot-job itself and associated infrastructure (e.g, the
%literature abounds with inconsistent usage of the term ``workflow
%systems'').

\subsection{Elements of the P* Model}


\noindent This sub-section defines the elements of the P* Model:


%\alnote{use pilot NOT pilot-job}
\noindent$\bullet$ \textbf{\pilot (Pilot-Compute):} The \pilot is the
  entity that actually gets submitted and scheduled on a resource.
% via the resource's RM system. 
  The PJ provides application (user)
  level control and management of the set of allocated resources.

  % and is responsible for the execution of \alwave{SUs/tasks}
  % onto the resource.

  % \alnote{\textbf{The RM assigns a slice of the Resource to the
  %     pilot -- that pilot then acts as RM for that resource slice.}
  %   I think simply equating a pilot with a RM is bit too
  %   simplistic. In a sense it is a application-level resource
  %   manger. Not sure what to do}

\noindent$\bullet$ \textbf{\computeunit  (\cu):} A \cu  encapsulates a 
  self-contained piece of work (a task) specified by the application that is
  submitted to the \pilotjob framework. There is no intrinsic notion
  of resource associated with a \cu.

\noindent$\bullet$ \textbf{Scheduling Unit (SU):} SUs are the units of 
  scheduling, internal to the P* Model, i.e., it is not known by or
  visible to an application. Once a \cu is
  under the control of the \pilotjob framework, it is assigned
  to an SU.
  % An SU is created after the submission of
  %   a \cu, i.\,e.\ once a \cu \ has been passed into the control of the
  %   pilot-job framework. 
%  \jhanote{Could we say: Once a \cu has been
%    passed into the control of the pilot-job framework, it is assigned
%    to an SU} \alnote{sounds good. done.}

\noindent$\bullet$ \textbf{Pilot-Manager (PM):} The PM is responsible for (i)
  orchestrating the interaction between the \pilots as well as the
  different components of the P* Model (\cus, \sus) and (ii) decisions
  related to internal resource assignment (once resources have been
  acquired by the \pilotjob).  For example, an SU can consists of one
  or more \cus. Further, \cus and \sus can be combined and aggregated;
  the PM determines how to group them, when \sus are scheduled and
  executed on a resource via the \pilot, as well as how many resources
  to assign to an SU.

% the different characteristics of the P* model. It
%   facilitates the coordination between the different P* elements,
%   i.\,e.\ the pilots, \cus and SUs. 
% A PM can e.\,g.\ manage solely one
%   or multiple pilots.

%   For example, the PM has the flexibility to combine and schedule \cus,
%   e.\,g.\ it can determine when a \cu is run and what as well as how
%   many resources it will receive.


% The application itself is not strictly part of the core P* Model.
% The term application generally refers to the upper layer of the
% stack.

An application kernel is the actual binary that gets executed.  The
application utilizes a PJ framework to execute multiple instances of
an application kernel (an ensemble) or alternatively instances of
multiple different application kernels (a workflow).  To execute an
application kernel, an application must define a \cu \ specifying the
application kernel as well as other parameters. This \cu \ is then
submitted to the PM (as an entry point to the
\pilotjob framework), where it transitions to an SU. The PM is then
responsible for scheduling the SU onto a \pilot and then onto a
physical resource.  As we will see in \S\ref{sec:pilot-job-frameworks}, 
the above elements can
be mapped to specific entities in many \pilotjobs in existence and
use; often more than one logical element may be rolled into a specific
entity in a \pilotjob.

% \textbf{Diane Definition of Terms: } The computation consists of
% many worker processes which communicate with one master process (the
% worker processes do not need to share the filesystem nor
% memory). The ensemble of computation is called a run and it consists
% of many tasks which may be executed in parallel. A task is defined
% as a set of parameters which are produced by the RunMaster (running
% on a master node) and consumed by the WorkerAgent (running on a
% worker node).
% 
% from 
% 
% DIANE assumes the master-worker computing model (Fig.
% 1). Client sends job parameters to the Planner which partitions
% the job into smaller tasks executed by the Workers. Integrator
% is responsible for merging the results of task execution and
% sending the final job outcome to the Client.


\subsection{Characteristics of P* Model}
\label{sec:p_star_elements}


%\jhanote{Why not have Binding as the first characteristics?}

% To understand % the degrees of freedom that any specific pilot-job
% % implementation must constraint as well as
% the functioning of
% pilot-jobs implementation, 
%These characteristics are integral components of the P* Model, in
% Further, these properties are important for the implementation of
% P*.  list several characteristics.
% The way the coordination between the different elements
% is handled is required to understand a PJ implementation.
 
We propose a set of fundamental properties/characteristics that
describe the interactions between the elements, and thus aid in the
description of P* Model.

% \alnote{ok} \jhanote{One strategy could be to not define the different
%   types, but just list/enumerate? Akin to Communication. i.e. explain
%   what coordination is for, what is being coordinated, how (the 3
%   types)}

\textbf{Coordination:} The coordination characteristics describe how
various elements of the P* Model, i.\,e.\ the PM, the \pilot, the \cus
and the SUs, interact. A common coordination pattern is master/worker
(M/W): the PM represents the master process that controls a set of
worker processes, the \pilots. The point of decision making is the
master process. In addition to the \emph{centralized} M/W, M/W can
also be deployed \emph{hierarchically}.  Alternatively, coordination
between the elements, in particular the \pilots, can be performed so as
to be \emph{decentralized}, i.\,e.\ without central decision making
point.

%\input{sectionIII-comments}

\textbf{Communication:} The communication characteristics describes the
mechanisms for data exchange between the elements of the P* Model:
e.\,g.\ messages (point-to-point, all-to-all, one-to-all, all-to-one,
or group-to-group), streams (potentially unicast or multicast),
publish/subscribe messaging or shared data spaces.
		
\textbf{Scheduling:} The scheduling characteristics describes the
process of mapping a SU to resources via a \pilot and potential
multiple levels of scheduling. Scheduling has a spatial component
(which SU is executed on which \pilot?) but also a temporal component
(when to bind?). The different scheduling decisions that need to be
made are representative of multi-level scheduling decisions that are
often required in distributed environments.  For example, when should
a SU be bound to a \pilot?  An SU can be bound to a \pilot either before
the \pilot has in turn been scheduled ({\it early} binding), whereas
{\it late} binding occurs if the SU is bound after the \pilot has been
scheduled.  In general, there are multiple-levels at which scheduling
decisions, i.e., resource selection and binding, are made.

The term {\it agent}, although not a part of the P* Model, finds
mention when discussing implementations. For the purposes of this
paper, an agent refers to a ``proxy process'' 
% that either % inside the % pilot-job framework
that has some decision making capability, and could aid the
implementation of one or more of the characteristics of the P* Model
-- coordination, communication, scheduling, within a \pilotjob
framework.  These agents can be used to enforce a set of
(user-defined) policies (e.g.  resource capabilities, data/compute
affinities, etc.) and heuristics.




\subsection{P* as a Model for Pilot-Data}
\label{sec:pilot-data}
\alnote{Should we merge this with section 2... At least we need to
  move it before the performance section}

\jhanote{Yes, and we need to supplement it. Maybe cut-n-paste from
  architecture / flow from the MR paper for the meantime?}

\note{Reviewer Comment: Perhaps the most interesting component of the research 
is the generalization of the model to data, beyond computing jobs. This 
portion of the research could probably benefit from being expanded.}


Many scientific applications have immense data requirements, which are
projected to increase dramatically in the near
future~\cite{hey2009}. The small genome alignment tool
scenario presented above e.\,g.\ operates on a input data set of
$>7$\,GB. While Pilot-Jobs efficiently support late-binding of
\computeunits and resources, the management of data in distributed
systems remains a challenge due to various reasons: (i) the placement
of data is often decoupled from the placement of Compute Units and
Pilots, i.\,e.\ the application must often manually stage in and out
its data using simple scripts;  (ii) heterogeneity, e.\,g.\ with
respect to storage, filesystem types and paths, often prohibits or at
least complicates late binding decisions; (iii) higher-level
abstraction that allow applications to specify their data dependencies
on an abstract, logical level (rather than on file basis) are not
available; (iv) due to lack of a common treatment for compute and
data, optimizations of data/compute placements are often not
possible. 
% For example, in scenario (B3) and (B4) presented in
% section~\ref{sec:fg-xsede-osg-egi}, even though the 50\,\% of the
% input data set is shared for all \cus, the complete data is staged for
% each \cu.

In addition, applications must cope with various other challenging,
data-related issues, e.\,g.\ varying data sources (such as sensors
and/or other application components), fluctuating data rates, transfer
failures, optimizations for different queries, data-/compute
co-location etc. While these issues can be in principal handled in an
application-specific way, the usage of higher-level abstractions, such
as a common \pilot-based abstraction for compute and data is
preferable.  

% Thus, having defined the P* model, we explore its extension to data.

This motivates an analogous abstraction that we call \emph{\pilotdata
  (PD)}. \jwave{PD provides late-binding capabilities for data by
  separating the allocation of physical storage and application-level
  data units.} Further, it provides an abstraction for expressing and
managing relationships between data units and/or compute units. These
relationships are referred to as \emph{affinities}.

% \jhanote{difficult to use affinity without defining it..}
% \alnote{tried to describe affinities a little bit better}

%\alnote{Extension vs. Application vs. Translation}
\subsubsection*{P* Model Elements for Data}

% A Pilot-Data Framework facilitates the late-binding between data units
% and physical storage resources, the so called pilot-stores.

The elements defined by P* can be extended by the following elements:

%\alnote{What is the role of SU in Data?}

\noindent$\bullet$
  \textbf{\pilot (Pilot-Data):} A \pilotdata (\pd) functions as a 
	placeholder object that reserves the space
	for data units. PD facilitates the late-binding of data and resource and is
	equivalent to the \pilot in the compute model.

\noindent$\bullet$
  \textbf{Data Unit (DU):} DU is the base unit of data assigned by
  the application,  e.\,g.\ a data file or chunk. Multiple DUs can be aggregated 
   within a Data Unit Set.

% \noindent$\bullet$ \textbf{Pilot-Data (PD):} PD allows the logical grouping of DUs
%   and the expression of data-data affinities. This collection of files
%   can be associated with an extensible set of properties. One of these
%   properties is affinity. 

\noindent$\bullet$
  \textbf{Scheduling Unit (SU):} is an internal unit of scheduling (as in 
  the compute case). The Pilot framework can aggregate or split DUs into one 
  or more SUs.

\noindent$\bullet$ 
  The \textbf{Pilot-Manager (PM)} is the same as in the compute model and
  implements the different characteristics of the P* Model. It is responsible for
  managing \dus and \sus. Data is submitted to the framework via the PM. The PM
  which is responsible for mapping \dus to \sus and for conducting decision 
  regarding resource assignments. \sus are placed on physical resources via the \pilot.

Note, each element can be mapped to an element in the P* Model by
symmetry, e.\,g., a DU correspond to a \cu  in the original P* Model; 
a PD is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of storage on a physical 
resource and corresponds to the \pilot in the P* Model.

% \jhanote{PJ Model is confusing. Either it is P Model or PJ
%   Framework} \alnote{ok}

% A particular critical requirement for data-intensive application, is
% the management of affinity between DUs and also between \cus and
% DUs. Thus, Pilot-Data introduces the PD container object for
% expressing relationships between DUs. A PD corresponds to an SU in
% the \jwave{PJ model}, i.\,e.\ it is used as scheduling unit for
% internal optimizations, e.\,g.\ the grouping of DUs. Having
% instantiated a PD, it can be assigned to a PS via the PD manager. A
% PS is a placeholder reserving a certain amount of storage, i.\,e.\
% it corresponds to a pilot in the pilot-job model. By associating a
% PD to a PS the data is actually moved to the physical location
% associated with the PS. The PD manager facilitates the creation of
% PSs, schedules data movements (with respect to specified affinities)
% and manages data accesses.

\subsubsection*{P* Model Characteristics for Data}

While the extended P* Model introduces new elements, the
characteristics however, remain the same to a great extent. The
coordination characteristic describes how the elements of PD interact,
e.\,g.\ utilizing the M/W model; the communication characteristic can
be applied similarly. The scheduling characteristics must be extended
to not only meet compute requirements, but also to support common data
access patterns. \jhanote{Propose comment out due to space
  restrictions: The scheduling component particularly needs to
  consider affinities, i.\,e.\ user-defined relationships between \cus
  and/or \dus. Data-data affinities e.\,g.\ exist if different \dus
  must be present at the same compute element; data-compute affinities
  arise if data and compute must be co-located for a computation, but
  their current location is different.} Data and compute placement
decisions are made by the scheduler based on defined policies,
affinities \& dynamic resource information.


\subsection{Putting it all together} \jhanote{Should this come after
  the next subsection on ``P* as a model for Pilot-Data''}\alnote{ok,
needs refinement for Pilot-DAta}
\alnote{Should we make Figure 1 generic to data and compute or have it include
both?} \alnote{invoke that Figure 1 is for simplicity only focusing on compute. Invoke symmetry.}

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_pstar} illustrates the interactions between the
elements of the P* Model using Pilot-Compute as example. First, the
application specifies the capabilities of the resources required using a
\pilotjob description (step 1). The PM then submits the necessary number of
\pilots to fulfill the resource requirements of the application (step~2). Each
\pilot is queued at the resource manager, which is responsible for starting
the \pilot (step~3). There can be variations of this flow: while in the
described model, the application defines the required resources, the PM could
also decide based on the submitted \cu \ workload whether and when it submits
new \pilots.

%\jhanote{What about the Resource Manager? Is it part of the resource}

The application can submit \cus to the PM at any time (step~4). A
submitted \cu \ becomes an SU, i.\,e.\ the PM is now in control of
it. In the simplest case one \cu \ corresponds to one SU; however,
SUs can be combined and aggregated to optimize throughputs and
response times. Commonly, a hierarchical M/W model for coordination
is used internally: the PM uses M/W to coordinate a set of \pilots,
the \pilot itself functions as manager for the execution of the
assigned SUs.


Scheduling decisions can be made on multiple levels. The PM is responsible for
selecting a \pilot for an SU (step 5). A \pilot is bound to a physical
resource on which it is responsible for a particular resource set. Once a SU
has been scheduled to a \pilot, the \pilot decides when and on which part of
the resource an SU is executed.
% \jhanote{Isn't
%   the pilot already bound to a specific resource? Or isn't the pilot
%   bound to a resource and thereby the SU bound to a resource

Further, the \pilot manages the subsequent execution of an SU (step~6).
There can be variations of this flow. 
% The above description presents a

PJ frameworks with decentralized decision making e.\,g.\ often utilize
autonomic agents that accept respectively pull SUs according to a set of
defined policies.

\alnote{TODO: add paragraph on Pilot-Data}


\note{Reviewer Comment:  For instance, utilities such as GLexec which have 
been developed so that the security model is preserved between the execution 
of the SU and the CU should be part of P* and appear somewhere in Figure 1.}

\note{Reviewer Comment: As the name suggest, the Pilot Job concept is very 
computation oriented and how to make the model evolve towards a solution which 
would be able to take into account application data requirements is an open 
question. Authors actually identifies this issue as Section 6 is devoted to an 
abstraction for Pilot-Data. However, the Pilot-Data API, which more or less 
mimics the PilotJob API is not very convincing in the sense that the 
interaction between the 2 APIs are not discussed at all. Maybe Pilot-Data 
should be presented as part of the P* model and section 6 should be dedicated 
to the implementation of the 2 APIs to data-intense computing.}

\subsection{Condor-G/Glide-in}

\jhanote{Condense into no more than 5-6 sentences}


The Condor project pioneered the concept of Pilot-Jobs by introducing the
\textit{Condor-G/Glide-in} mechanisms~\cite{condor-g} which allow the
temporary addition of Globus GRAM controlled HPC resources to a Condor
resource pool.In this scenario, the \pilot is exposed as a complete Condor
pool that is started via the Globus GRAM service of a resource. This mechanism
is referred to as Condor Glide-in. Subsequently, jobs (CUs) can be submitted
to the Condor Glide-in pool using the standard Condor tools and APIs.

% Condor utilizes a
% master/worker coordination model. The PJ manager is referred to as the
% Condor Central Manager. The functionality of the Central Manager is
% provided by several daemons: the \texttt{condor\_master} that is generally
% responsible for managing all daemons on a machine, the
% \texttt{condor\_collector} which collects resource information, the
% \texttt{condor\_negotiator} that does the matchmaking and the \texttt{condor\_schedd}
% that is responsible for managing the binding and scheduling
% process. Condor generally does not differentiate between workload,
% i.\,e.\ \cu, and schedulable entity, i.\,e.\ SU. Both entities are
% referred to as job. However, it supports late binding, i.\,e.\
% resources a job is eventually submitted to are not required to be available at
% submission time. The scheduler matches the capabilities required by a
% \cu to the available resources. This process is referred to as
% matchmaking. Further, a priority-based scheduler is used. For
% communication between the identified elements Condor utilizes
% point-to-point messaging using a binary protocol on top of TCP.
% 
% Different fault tolerance mechanisms, such as automatic retries, are
% supported.  Further, Condor supports different security mechanisms:
% for authentication it integrates both with local account management
% systems (such as Kerberos) as well as grid authentication systems such
% as GIS. Communication traffic can be encrypted.

    % 	\end{figure}


% General overview of BJ implementations & P* model
%PJ implementations in TROY are called BigJob (BJ)~\cite{bigjob_web}.

BigJob (BJ)~\cite{bigjob_web,saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} is a SAGA-based PJ
framework. BJ has been designed to be general-purpose and extensible. While BJ
has been originally built for HPC infrastructures, such as XSEDE and
FutureGrid, it is generally also usable in other environments. This
extensibility mainly arises from the usage of SAGA~\cite{saga_url,ogf-gfd-90} 
as a common API for accessing distributed resources. 
% SAGA provides a
% simple, POSIX-style API to the most common grid functions at a sufficiently
% high-level of abstraction so as to be independent of the diverse and dynamic
% grid environments.
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_re_bigjob_interactions} illustrates the
BJ architecture and its mapping to P*. The architecture reflects
all P* elements: The BJ-Manager is the Pilot-Manager responsible for
coordinating the different components of the frameworks. The
BigJob-Agent is the actual \pilot that is submitted to a
resource. \cus are referred to as sub-jobs. Internally \cus are mapped
1:1 to \sus.

% \jhanote{we'll have to unfortunately describe saga briefly in order to
%   make saga-based clear/obvious}\alnote{ok, moved a sentence from
%   Pilot-API section up front.}

          decentral component referred to as the BigJob-Agent. Sub-job
          -- the \cus -- are submitted via the PM. \cus are mapped 1:1

\end{figure}


BJ implements the following P* characteristic: As coordination model the M/W
scheme is used: The BJ-Manager is the central entity, which manages the actual
\pilot, the BJ-Agent. Each agent is responsible for gathering local
information, for pulling sub-jobs from the manager, and for executing SUs on
its local resource. The SAGA Advert Service is used for communication between
manager and agent. The Advert Service (AS) exposes a shared data space that
can be accessed by manager and agent, which use the AS to realize a push/pull
communication pattern, i.\,e.\ the manager pushes a SU to the AS while the
agents periodically pull for new SUs. Results and state updates are similarly
pushed back from the agent to the manager. Further, BJ provides a pluggable
communication \& coordination layer and also supports other \cc systems
besides the AS, e.\,g.\ Redis~\cite{redis} and ZeroMQ~\cite{zmq}.


%\subsection{BigData: A \pilotdata Implementation}

% Analogous to \pilotjobs, {\it Pilot-Data} (PD) abstraction provides late-binding
% capabilities for data by separating the storage allocation and application-level
% \dataunits~\cite{pstar-2012}. For this purpose, the API defines the {\it
% \pilotdata (PD)} and {\it \dataunit (DU)} entity: A \pd function as a
% placeholder object that reserves storage spaces for a set of \dus.
% 
% \begin{figure}[t]
% 	\upp\upp
% 	\centering
% 		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/bigdata.pdf}
% 	\caption{BigData Architecture and Interactions\upp\upp\upp\upp\upp\upp}
% 	\label{fig:figures_bigdata}
% \end{figure}

{\it BigData (BD)} is an implementation of the Pilot-Data abstraction. BigData
is designed as an extension of BigJob. Similar to BigJob, it is comprised of
two components: the BD-Manager and the BD-Agents, which are deployed on the
physical resources. The coordination scheme used is Master-Worker (MW), with
some decentralized intelligence located at the BD-Agent. The BD-Manager is
responsible for (i) meta-data management, i.\,e.\ it keeps track of all \pd
and associated \dus, (ii) for scheduling of data movements and replications
(taking into account the application requirements defined via affinities), and
(iii) for managing data movements activities. BigData supports plug-able
storage adaptors -- currently an adaptor for SSH, WebHDFS~\cite{webhdfs} and
Globus Online~\cite{10.1109/MIC.2011.64} is provided.

% BJ currently uses a simple scheduling mechanism based on an internal queue: each
% \cu submitted to the BigJob framework is mapped to a SU. Binding can take place
% at submission time (early binding) or delayed in case of multiple \pilots (late
% binding). For scheduling, a simple FIFO queue is used (see also
% table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison}).


% In many scenarios it is beneficial to utilize multiple resources, e.\,g.\ to
% accelerate the time-to-completion or to provide resilience to resource failures
% and/or unexpected delays. BigJob allows dynamic resource additions/removals as
% well as late binding. The support of this feature depends on the backend used.
% To support this feature on top of various BigJob implementations that are by
% default restricted to single resource use, the concept of a BigJob pool is
% introduced. A BigJob pool consists of multiple BJs (each BigJob managing one
% particular resource). An extensible scheduler is used for dispatching \cus to
% one of the BJs of the pool (late binding). By default a FIFO scheduler is used.



% \note{OW says: Where is that magic BigJob-Pool and its scheduler? Is there an
% API for that? That's also part of the capabilities provided by
% bigjob-server.}\alnote{The BigJob pool is formerly known as ManyJob. In the
% bigjob/examples directory, there are multiple examples (e.g.
% example\_manyjob\_local.py) that show how multiple BJ can be used concurrently.}

\subsection{DIANE}

\jhanote{Condense into no more than 5-6 sentences}

% Coordination and Communication
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} is a task coordination framework, which
was originally designed for implementing master/worker applications,
but also provides PJ functionality for job-style executions. it
utilizes a single hierarchy of worker agents and a PJ manager
referred to as \texttt{RunMaster}.
%Further, there is ongoing work on a multi-master extension.
For the spawning of PJs a separate script, the so-called submitter script, is
required. For the access to the physical resources the GANGA
framework~\cite{Moscicki20092303} can be used.
%GANGA provides a
%unified interface for job submissions to various resource types, e.\,g.\ EGI
%resources or TG resources via a SAGA backend.
Once the worker agents are started they register themselves at the RunMaster.
For communication between the RunMaster and worker agents point-to-point
messaging based on CORBA~\cite{OMG-CORBA303:2004} is used. CORBA is also used
for file staging.

% Binding 
% DIANE is primarily designed with respect to HTC environments (such as
% EGI~\cite{egi}), i.\,e.\ one PJ consists of a single worker agent with the
% size of 1 core.
% To use DIANE on HPC environments, a so-called multinode submitter script can be
% used: the scripts starts a defined number of worker agents on a certain
% resource.
% However, \cus will be constrained to the specific number of cores
% managed by a worker agent.
% By default a \cu  is mapped to a SU; application can however implement smarter
% allocation schemes, e.\,g.\ the clustering of multiple \cus into a SU.

%Scheduling
DIANE includes a simple capability matcher and FIFO-based task scheduler.
Plugins for other workloads, e.\,g.\ DAGs or for data-intensive
application, exist or are under development. The framework is extensible:
applications can implement a custom application-level scheduler.


%Other impl. related issues: FT and security
% DIANE is, like BJ, a single-user PJ, i.\,e.\ each PJ is executed with the privileges
% of the respective user. Also, only \cus of this respective user are executed
% by DIANE. DIANE supports various middleware security mechanisms (e.\,g.\ GSI,
% X509). For this purpose it relies on GANGA.
% Further, DIANE supports fault tolerance: basic error detection and propagation
% mechanisms are in place. Further, an automatic re-execution of \cus is
% possible.






% \subsection{Swift/Coaster}
% 
% \jhanote{Eliminate?}
% 
% Swift~\cite{Wilde2011} is a scripting language designed for expressing
% abstract workflows and computations. The language provides, amongst many other
% things, capabilities for executing external applications, as well as the
% implicit management of data flows between application tasks. 
% % For this
% % purpose, Swift formalizes the way that applications can define
% % data-dependencies. Using so called mappers, these dependencies can be
% % easily extended to files or groups of files. 
% The runtime environment handles the allocation of resources and the spawning of 
% the compute tasks. 
% % Both data- and execution management capabilities are provided
% % via abstract interfaces. 
% Swift supports e.\,g.\ Globus, Condor and PBS resources. 
% % The pool of resources
% % that is used for an application is statically defined in a configuration file.
% % While this configuration file can refer to highly dynamic resources (such as OSG
% % resources), there is no possibility to manage this resource pool
% % programmatically. 
% By default, Swift uses a 1:1 mapping for \cus and \sus. However,
% Swift supports the grouping of SUs as well as PJs. For the PJ functionality, Swift uses the
% Coaster~\cite{coasters} framework. Coaster relies on a master/worker
% coordination model; communication is implemented using GSI-secured TCP sockets.
% Swift and Coaster support various scheduling mechanisms, e.\,g.\ a FIFO and a
% load-aware scheduler. Additionally, Swift can be used in conjunction with 
% Falkon~\cite{1362680}, which also provides \pilot-like functionality.

% Falkon
% refers to \pilots as the so called provisioner, which are created using the
% Globus GRAM service. The provisioner spawns a set of executor processes on the
% allocated resources, which are then responsible for managing the execution of
% SUs. \cus are submitted via a so called dispatcher service. Similar to Coaster,
% Falkon utilizes a M/W coordination model, i.\,e.\ the executors periodically
% query the dispatcher for new SUs. Web services are used for communication.

\subsection{Discussion}

P* provides an abstract model for describing and understanding PJ
frameworks, i.e., different components of PJ frameworks can be mapped
to the P* elements.  While each of the frameworks maintains its own
vocabulary, all share the common P* elements.
Table~\ref{table:bigjob-saga-diane} summarizes how P* can be applied
to BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G/Glide-in.
Table~\ref{table:pilot-job-comparison} summarizes the P*
characteristic and other properties of these frameworks. While most of
these frameworks share many properties, such as the M/W coordination
model, they differ in characteristics, such as the communication model
or scheduling. \jhanote{OK, so the elements map to the different
  components, so what? what is the take home message?}

As we will see further in \S V (Experiments), in spite of a common
Pilot-API each PJ framework has a rather different usage modality;
this is reflective of the fact that typically, PJ frameworks ``evolve
in'' and are ``native to'' specific infrastructure. Native
infrastructure refers to the infrastructure for which a PJ framework
has been primarily developed for and on which infrastructures it is
mainly used, e.g., Condor-G/Glide-in is the native PJ framework of the
Open Science Grid and its use is heavily coupled with WMS; that does
not mean, however, that these frameworks do not work on other
infrastructures. \jhanote{This should be merged in the discussion
  section that I have been asking for}


%Both BigJob and Swift have been
%developed for traditional US cyberinfrastructures, such as
%XSEDE. DIANE is native to EGI e-infrastructure.


% In the next section we will show how these frameworks can be exposed via the 
%Pilot-API.
% In addition to mapping the P* model to different PJ frameworks, we also
% expose BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G/Glide-in through the Pilot-API (see 
% section~\ref{sec:pilot-api}),
% i.\,e.\ the Pilot-API can now be used as a unified abstraction across
% multiple PJ frameworks (see figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}).  


\alnote{We haven't introduced the Pilot-API yet This validates (i)
the P* abstractions and (ii) the extensibility of the P*
model.}




% \note{TROY provides a
%   unified API that can be used to expose various PJ frameworks
%   (e.\,g.\ BigJob, DIANE and Condor-G). Further, it enables the
%   concurrent usage of multiple PJ frameworks (see
%   figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}). The SAGA inspired
%   approach to TROY's API design --- its SAGA inspired adaptor-based
%   architecture, leverage the design experiences of SAGA, are appealing
%   to the pilot-job user community. Also, the chosen designs enables
%   the easy exchange of PJ implementations and the concurrent use of
%   multiple PJ frameworks. TROY thus functions as common access layer
%   for different PJ frameworks, providing interoperability and
%   portability of PJ applications. To some extent, the TROY API can be
%   considered to be a prototype of a PJ-like API extension to SAGA (see
%   Discussion \& future work, \S\ref{sec:discussion-future-work}).}

for pilot job systems. While the work seemed sound, I was unconvinced by the
paper that another layer of indirection and abstraction was the right solution
for connecting together pilot job systems. Perhaps another element which could
strengthen the paper is a description, based on the authors analysis of pilot
job systems, why pilot job systems cannot be unified in other ways.}

% Note to Shantenu:
%
%   There exist two ways toward system federation (i) deep integration
%   of systems (system level, interoperation), and (ii) abstract
%   interfaces (application level, integration).
%
% Shantenu, I do agree that the above version is possibly correct, and
% it gives me something to think about :-)  But for the purpose of the
% paper, it may actually complicate things.  For one, our discussion
% of WFs below does not distinguish between interoperation and
% integration, and adding that distinction is adding noise to the text
% (I tried that, it reads aweful).
% 
% More importantly, we user interoperation elsewhere in the text, for
% example when we talk about "Understanding PJ Framework
% Interoperability".  Now, on that level we do not really do interop,
% according to the definition above, but integration (we change none
% of the systems internally, apart from possibly bigjob).  So, we
% would have to change that discussion to integration, which is, while
% being correct I think, complicating the discussion, and also
% somewhat less intuitive for the reader (I think).
% 
% I thus left the definition for now, but please feel free to change
% it, if you feel that the increased correctnes is worth the effort to
% keep the paper consistent.

At a high-level, there exist two approaches towards interoperability:
(i) deep integration of systems (system level interoperability), and
(ii) the use abstract interfaces (application level interoperability).
Approach (i) requires a certain level of semantic harmonization
between the systems, and is (in principle and technically) hard to
achieve post-facto, even if the respective systems inherently
implement the same abstract model (here: the P* Model).  While
interoperation via an abstract interface (ii) (here: Pilot-API) is a
semantically weaker approach than (i), it does allow for
interoperability with minimal (application level)
effort~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud,saga_gin}.


% Workflow (WF) capabilities and engines are typically tied to specific
% tools and infrastructure (e.\,g.\ DAGMan-Condor) and require the
% adaption of the application to the WF engine as opposed to the other
% way around. 

The current state of workflow (WF) systems~\cite{nsf-workflow,1196459}
provides a motivating example for the P* Model and the Pilot-API:
even though many WF systems exist (with significant duplicated
effort), they provide limited means for extensibility and
interoperability.  We are not naive enough to suggest a single reason,
but assert that one important contributing fact is the lack of the
right interface abstractions upon which to construct workflow systems;
had those been available, many/most WF engines would have likely
utilized them (or parts thereof), instead of proprietary solutions.
%
% That would not immediately allow WF implementations to interoperate,
% but would make semantic mapping between them significantly simpler,
% thus supporting the very notion of interoperation.
%
Significant effort has been invested towards WF interoperability at
different levels -- if nothing else, providing post-facto
justification of its importance. The impact of missing interface
abstractions on the WF world can be seen through the consequences of
their absence: WF interoperability remains difficult if not
infeasible. The Pilot-API in conjunction with the P* Model aims to
prevent similar situation for \pilotjobs.

%\footnote{To be fair: we are not sure if a generic model and/or a
%  generic WF API are achievable {\it on a useful level} -- we think,
%  nevertherless, that our discussion is valid.}

We appreciate the difficulty balancing the level of semantic
expressivity for API's designed to work on multiple semantically
heterogeneous systems: defining the API as 'smallest common
denominator' is often too simplifying and misses large numbers of
'edge' use cases; defining the API as 'greatest common factor'
clutters the API with non-portable semantics and making the API too
complex~\cite{leaky_abstractions}.  The Pilot-API uses the Pareto
principle as a guideline for a balanced abstraction level.


% While no single solution can address
% all levels nor the entire spectrum of applications, the Pilot-API
% exposes effective abstractions that can hide environmental complexity,
% supplement the incompleteness and lack-of-extensibility of many tools,
% and generalize customized run-time solutions for a broad range of
% applications.

\subsection{Understanding the Pilot-API}


% \alnote{We don't establish that the BJ API is semantically equivalent to the 
% Pilot-API.}

The Pilot-API is a Python-based API and supports two different usage modes (i)
it provides a unified API to various PJ frameworks (e.\,g.\ BigJob, DIANE and
Condor-G/Glide-in), and (ii) it enables the concurrent usage of multiple PJ
implementations.

The Pilot-API classes and interactions are designed to reflect the P*
elements and characteristics.
% Table~\ref{table:pstar_elements} summarizes the mapping of P* elements and the
% Pilot-API.
The API exposes the primary functionality of the Pilot-Manager using two
classes: the \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} for the management of \pilots
and the \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} for the management of \cus. 
As defined by P*, a \cu represents a primary self-containing piece of work that
is submitted through the Pilot-API. 
%At the API boundary a \cu transitions to a SU, which functions as internal unit
%of scheduling.

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_pilot_api_flow} shows the interactions between the
P* elements.
The Pilot-API decouples workload management and resource scheduling by exposing
two separate services: The \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} and
\texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service}. 
The \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} serves as a factory for instantiating \pilots. 
Also, the \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} can be used to query for currently
active \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} instan\-ces.
A \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} instance is returned as result of the
\texttt{create\_pilot()} method of the \texttt{Pi\-lot\-Compute\-Service} (step 1).
Analogous to job creation in SAGA, the instantiation of the
\texttt{Pilot\-Compute} instance is done by using a
\texttt{Pilot\-ComputeDescription}. The description can be reused and has no
state, while the \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} instance has state and is a reference
for further usage.\\

                          pc_desc, 'bigjob')
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} object represents a \pilot instance and allows the 
application to interact with it, e.\,g.\ to query its state or to cancel 
it. The process of \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} creation is depicted in step 1-2 of 
figure~\ref{fig:figures_pilot_api_flow} and in listing~\ref{lst:pcs_creation}.

Listing~\ref{lst:cus_creation} shows the creation of
a \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service}.  Having created
a \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} instance, \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service}
instances can be added and removed at any time.  This enables applications to
respond to dynamic resource requirements at runtime, i.\,e.\ additional
resources can be requested on peak demands, and can be released if they are no
longer required.\\

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Instantiation

\end{lstlisting}

\end{minipage}

% \lstset{
% caption={\textbf{WorkUnit Submission:} Instantiation and Submission of a \texttt{WorkUnitDescription}.\label{lst:submission}}
% }

The \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} is responsible for managing the execution of
\cus.
Regardless of the state of the \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service}, applications can submit \cus to a
\texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} at anytime (listing~\ref{lst:submission} and step 3
in figure~\ref{fig:figures_pilot_api_flow}). 
Once the \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} becomes responsible for a \cu, the \cu
transitions to an SU.
SUs are internally processed (e.\,g.\ they can be aggregated) and are then scheduled to the Pilot-Job Framework (step 4). 
The PJ framework is responsible for the actual execution of the SU on a
resource.
Note that multiple levels of (hierarchical) scheduling can be present, commonly
a SU is scheduled inside a PJ framework and the model allows it to be present
in multiple layers.



% In figure~\ref{fig:figures_pilot_api_flow} the flow of a simple execution scenario is
% displayed. The Pilot Job Service and the Work Unit Service are already
% instantiated. The application requests the Pilot Job Service to create a new
% pilot-job (step 1), the Pilot Job Service will pass the request on to the
% relevant adaptor (step 2), which will eventually launch the pilot-job on a
% resource using a pilot-job framework (step 3). At this stage there might be a
% pilot-job already available, or the request can still reside in a queue
% somewhere. Regardless of the state of the pilot-job, the application can submit
% a work unit to the Work Unit Service (step 4). The Work Unit Service remains
% responsible for keeping track of the Work Unit during its lifetime. Based on the
% heuristics or policies the WUS decides on a potential aggregation of SUs. The SU 
% is then forwarded to the Scheduler (step 5). The Scheduler will schedule SUs to 
% an appropriate adaptor that represents a capable resource (step 6). Finally, the
% adaptor will submit the SU to the PJ framework which will
% take care of the actual execution on a resource. Note that multiple levels of 
% (hierarchical) scheduling can be present. Inside
% TROY there is already scheduling taking place inside the Work Unit Service. 
% Additionally, the underlying PJ framework can conduct its own scheduling.


Each \texttt{Compute\-Unit} and \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} object is associated
with a state.
The state model is based on the SAGA job state model~\cite{ogf-gfd-90}.
Applications can query the state using the \texttt{get\_state()} method or they
can subscribe to state update notifications (by setting callbacks).

Finally, an application can have any number of \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} or
\texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} instances.
Multiple \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} instances can be associated to a
\texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service}, and a \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} can be associated to
multiple \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} instances.
A \texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service} can manage multiple \texttt{Compute\-Unit}
instances, but a \texttt{Compute\-Unit} can only be managed by one
\texttt{Compute\-Unit\-Service}.
So can a \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service} manage multiple
\texttt{Pilot\-Compute} instances, but can a \texttt{Pilot\-Compute} only be
managed by one \texttt{Pilot\-Compute\-Service}.

\subsection{Pilot-API for Data}\jhanote{I propose we
  call this Pilot-API for Data, not ``Extending''}\alnote{ok}

Analogous to the Pilot-API for Compute, the Pilot Data
API~\cite{pilot_api} defines the \texttt{PilotDataService} entity as
an abstraction for creating and managing pools of storage. A
\texttt{PilotData} instance represents the actual physical storage
space. The \texttt{ComputeDataService} entity functions as an
application-level scheduler, which accepts both
\texttt{Compute\-Units} and \texttt{DataUnits}. It resolves necessary
dependencies (e.g. data/data or data/computer affinities), and is
responsible for managing the execution of \dus and \cus.

\section{Experiments and Results}\label{sec:exp_res}

\note{Reviewer Note: Unfortunately, the experimental results are not
  very convincing. Firstly, the overhead caused by interoperability
  (P*) is not provided. And the introduced overheads are critical in
  understanding if it is a worthwhile approach. Secondly, the
  demonstration of interoperability is overly simplified. For example,
  so of these pilot job systems were never meant to operate decoupled
  from their computational frameworks. For example, Swift and
  Swift-Coasters were meant to work together. It’s not clear how one
  would interact with Swift-Coasters, without generating Swiftscript
  code (as opposed to simple job/task descriptions). The Swiftscript
  is very much a special instance of a way to implement some
  application logic. I would find it hard to believe that an
  application could adapt to such different requirements, where some
  application could be converted between some collection of jobs, to a
  Dagman/Condor workflow, to a Swift-Coaster workflow, and all this to
  be done automatically. If the complex workflow dependency management
  is taken out of the equation, then why bother to talk about the
  features of these workflow systems, such as the data from Table 2?
  More metrics like traffic, slowdown, and job speedup are needed to
  be measured to be convincing.}

\note{Reviewer Comment: The experiments are by far the weakest part of
  this paper. For the experiments parts, the authors didn't explain
  very well how they test the interoperability between Pilot-Jobs and
  infrastructures exist.  The results are also hard to follow, why
  certain experiments are done, and how to interpret the
  results. Experiments are not clear enough to support the
  arguments. Does not say how to handle the case if the function in
  the framework can not be map to the P* Model. Also, I was expecting
  that more time would be spend on the Pilot-Data model, and how this
  translated to the various pilot-based systems.}

In this section we analyze the performance and scalability of
different PJ frameworks.  It is important to note that our experiments
do not try to identify the ``fastest'' PJ framework, as this is
dependent on different factors, e.\,g.\ particularly the
infrastructure used -- the experiments are conducted on different
production (XSEDE, EGI, OSG) and research (FutureGrid)
infrastructures.

As discussed in \S\ref{sec:pilot-job-frameworks}, the investigated PJ
frameworks can be mapped to the P* Model, which enables their
collective usage via the Pilot-API. In
section~\ref{sec:pj_performance} we investigate the performance and
scalability of coordination in BigJob and DIANE, executing thousands
of tasks but with zero workload. We establish that for up to thousands
of tasks, existing coordination infrastructures suffice. \jhanote{We
  don't do the previous two sentences, do we?} \alnote{Well we did, but 
the figure is now not part of the paper anymore. We could say hundreds of

section~\ref{sec:fg-xsede-osg-egi} we show the effectiveness of our
approach (Pilot-API/P* Model) by executing {\it real application
  workloads} -- in this case a genome alignment application -- on
multiple distinct production infrastructures. Further, we demonstrate

\subsection{PJ Frameworks Overheads}\label{sec:pj_performance}

\jhanote{to be reduced significantly}\alnote{further reduced}

\alnote{What are the factors for overheads? coordination, file staging, file
systems, job submission? invoke SAGA Europar?}

Before we understand the performance of different frameworks in a real
application scenario, we analyze the typical overheads of PJ frameworks.
Commonly, the performance of a PJ framework is determined by different
factors: the job submission time, the queueing time, file staging time and the
coordination overhead.
% Different PJ implementation follow different design objectives --
% that also reflects in the designs of their communication \& coordination 
% (\cc) sub-systems. 
The job submission time is commonly very low compared to the overall runtime
(see~\cite{denBurger:2010:PSC:1887695.1887739} for an analysis). Both the queueing and file staging time heavily
depends on extrinsic factor, such as the current system and network load.
Thus, the primary barrier for performance and scalability is not the internal
coordination of the elements of a PJ implementation. There are many factors
that influence the overall coordination performance, e.\,g.\ the degree of
distribution (local (LAN) vs. remote (WAN)), the communication pattern (1:n
versus n:n) and the communication frequency.

For our \cc evaluation, we conducted several experiments on
FutureGrid~\cite{fg}. We executed a different number of very short running
(i.\,e. zero workload) \cus on Alamo and Sierra, running up to 128\,\cus 
concurrently.  This enables us to focus on the overhead induced
by the PJ framework and the \cc subsystem. Each experiment is
repeated at least 10 times.


% In the following we investigate the impact of different \cc related
% factors on the overall performance and scalability of PJ systems.
% We evaluate different BigJob configurations, and compare and
% contrast them with DIANE.

% BigJob's \cc was originally based on a shared, centralized data space, 
% the SAGA Advert Service (AS)~\cite{saga_advert}.  The
% communication between all components is done via this shared data
% space, which decouples BJ-Manager and BJ-Agent and allows both
% entities to operate at their own pace, optimizing the overall
% throughput.  A particular 

% An issue during distributed runs is the latency
% between the application and the (remote) Advert Service. Another
% challenge is that this design introduces a potential
% single-point-of-failure and scalability bottleneck if the centralized
% data space is not carefully designed and operated.

% BigJob also provides two alternative c\&c sub-systems:
% Redis~\cite{redis} and ZeroMQ~\cite{zmq}. Redis is a lightweight
% key/value store. Redis is used in a similar way as the AS, i.\,e.\ all 
% communication between BJ-Agent and BJ-Manager is
% channeled through it. In contrast, the ZeroMQ sub-system utilizes a
% client-server architecture, which is similar to the CORBA-based approach 
% of DIANE -- in this architecture, the PM maintains the
% overall state. Clients connect to the PM to request new SUs or to
% report state updates. An advantage of this architecture is that it
% does not require a separate infrastructure deployment for the \cc
% sub-system.

% Both the data space and the client-server \cc sub-systems can be
% combined with a publish/subscribe mechanism, i.\,e.\ instead of
% polling, an agent can receive notifications when a new SU arrives.




% \jhanote{Need to motivate testing of c\&c sub-system better: There are
%   many barriers to interoperability and performance. primary barrier to
%   performance is not \cu  submission or SU scheduling to PM, but the
%   fundamental limitation of scalability of coordination -- with
%   increasing number of \cu /SU.  Establish tradeoff between distributed
%   vs local coordination. e.g., It is easy to get consistency but has
%   overhead.  Easy to get performance but difficult to get
%   consistency. Thus we opt for centralized / persistent point. But how
%   does this single point-of-coordination behave with increasing number
%   of connections? } \alnote{hopefully addressed most points in paragraph above}

% 
% Figure~\ref{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-wus} illustrates the performance
% and scalability of different BJ configurations and DIANE with
% respect to the number of \cus. Clearly, the \cc sub-system has a great
% impact on the overall performance: the Redis backend shows the best
% performance for small \cu counts. The difference between local and
% remote coordination is moderate (about 20\,\%). While ZeroMQ is very
% fast and lightweight, it requires a careful implementation, in
% particular concerning synchronization and throughput optimization. The
% overall performance is slightly worse than for Redis. The Advert
% Service currently has some limitations which will be discussed later.
% DIANE shows a higher startup overhead, which is particularly
% observable for smaller \cu  numbers. However, the runtime increases only 
% slightly (about 10\,sec) when going from 64 to 2048 \cus. One reason is that 
% DIANE aggregates SUs: for 2048 \cus only a single task description is created, 
% which the framework efficiently distributes to its agents. BigJob in contrast 
% maintains a separate description for each \cu.
% At the investigated scales, the single manager does not represent a
% bottleneck with respect to the processable \cu  numbers. Further,
% the TROY manager introduces another hierarchy-level which can
% further enhance the overall scalability.


Figure~\ref{fig:perf_bigjob-varying-cores} illustrates the performance
scalability with respect to the number of cores per \pilot. For this purpose,
we execute 4\,\cus per core, i.\,e.\ between 32 and 512\,\cus. In particular,
the Redis (Local) configuration show an almost linear scalability up to 128
cores. The Redis (Remote) setup again imposes some overhead (about 14\,\%).
ZeroMQ performs very well with lower core counts; with larger core counts the
runtimes increase, indicating a potential scalability bottleneck. DIANE shows,
in particular for lower core counts, a longer runtime, again due to the higher
startup overhead. With higher core counts DIANE behaves similar to
BigJob/ZeroMQ, showing a greater increase of the overall runtime. This
increase can likely be attributed to the single central manager in the
client-server architecture. Using Redis as central data space decouples the 
Pilot-Manager and the Agent, which yields to a better performance in 
particular with a larger number of replicas.
% As in the last experiment,
% the Advert \cc sub-system showed a significantly lower performance.
% A reason for that
% is the used remote access protocol, which is basically the native
% remote PostgreSQL database protocol, which is not optimized for WAN
% connections. Further, the API is based on a hierarchical namespace,
% which does not easily map to relational databases -- in deeply nested
% namespaces exhibit an insufficient query and update performance. In

\subsection{Characterizing PJ Frameworks on DCI}
\label{sec:fg-xsede-osg-egi}


\subsubsection*{Production Infrastructure} 

To validate the abstractions developed,
such as Pilot-API, we conducted a series of
experiments on various production infrastructure. We executed
BFAST~\cite{bfast2009} using three different PJ frameworks (BigJob,
DIANE and Condor) on XSEDE~\cite{xsede}, FutureGrid~\cite{fg},
EGI~\cite{egi} and OSG~\cite{1742-6596-78-1-012057}.

Specifically, we utilized the following resources: XSEDE: Kraken (1.17\,PFlop 
Cray XT5 / 9,408\,nodes / 112,896\,cores / Torque), Trestles 
(100\,TFlop / 324\,nodes / 10,368\,cores / Torque) and QueenBee
(Linux Cluster / 668\,nodes / 5,344\,cores / PBS); FutureGrid:
India (108\,nodes / 864\,cores / PBS); European Grid
Initiative (EGI): Resource federation of 364,500 cores;
OSG: Condor pool (via the \textit{Engage} VO, Glide-in WMS,
20,000 Glide-ins).\footnote{Glide-in WMS is a software system built on
top of Condor-G/Glide-in, which can, based on the current and expected
number of jobs in the pool,  automatically increase or decrease the
number of active Glide-ins (\pilots) available to the pool.  While the
average number of active Glide-ins on OSG is around 20,000, more than
40,000 Glide-ins can be active and available for job execution during
peak load.}

 
%\jhanote{I would even introduce a sub-subsection on production
%  infrastructure used. That would enable us to keep Pilot-API/BigJob
%  specific details separate from infrastructure details. E.g., say
%  what is XSEDE? Say what is OSG? Thoughts?}  \alnote{good
%  idea. started to restructure section}


%\note{OW says: That would be the case if we use Condor-G. The machines
%is belhaven-1.renci.org - a Globus/PBS cluster that accepts Condor jobs.\\
%So the OSG is a peculiar beast. My current understanding is, that it consits 
%of a bunch of HPC clusters with a Globus frontend. OSG uses an automated 
%Glide-in WMS service that starts glide-ins via Condor-G on these clusters.
%The glide-ins are aggregated and presented to the OSG (HTC) user as a 
%standard condor pool for HTC jobs. While using OSG through condor seems 
%to be a popular mode of operation, it is possible to access any of the 
%OSG-member clusters via Condor-G and through Globus directly. As far as I
%understand, this is the preferred mode for running HPC (multi-core) 
%applications.\\
%This raises two important questions: does it make sense it all to use
%BigJob with the OSG condor pool? We would end up with one BJ agent per
%condor job which represents one core, which would just add a lot of overhead and
%no benefits. Using OSG via Condor-G or even Globus would allow us to
%take advantage of larger reservations, e.g. one BJ agent that manages
%128 cores.\\
%While it would make sense for TROY to implement a native Condor 'backend'
%that doesn't use another layer of 'agents' and master/worker advert 
%mechanisms, I don't think that this makes sense for BigJob. Depending on 
%what we want to show, I propose that we use BigJob with Globus (we now that 
%it works) on OSG. While this doesn't show pilot job interoperabiltiy
%(which his hard to achieve without TROY anyways), it still shows cross-grid
%interoperability.}


% To manage the genome sequencing workflow we use
% theDARE~\cite{dare-tg11-gateways} framework that has been built on
% top of TROY.

\subsubsection*{Experimental Configuration}

%\jhanote{Experimental Configuration = Infrastructure used, specific
%  machine (on XSEDE and FG) and resources configuration + PJ Framework
%  employed.}

We define an experimental configuration as a set comprised of the
production infrastructure used, the specific machine/resource
configuration, and the utilized PJ framework.  We run experiments
on four different configurations: (B1) BigJob/XSEDE, (B2)
BigJob/FutureGrid, (B3) two BigJob/Futuregrid, (B4) Condor/OSG, (B5)
DIANE/EGI. As discussed in \S\ref{sec:pilot-api}, the Pilot-API
provides a unified way for accessing these infrastructures using the
native PJ capabilities for all three PJ frameworks, i.\,e.\ BigJob,
DIANE and Condor (see figure~\ref{fig:figures_distributed_pilot_job}).
For BJ we use the PBS/SSH plugin to access both the FutureGrid and
XSEDE machines.  On OSG, we use SAGA and the SAGA-Condor adaptor to
interface directly with OSG's dynamic Glide-in-WMS resource
pool. Further, we utilize DIANE on EGI.
%\msnote{more on EGI later ...}
%On the XSEDE, Kraken is used with up to 512 cores concurrently.
%\amnote{why is the corecount mentioned for Kraken, and not the others?}

The investigated workload consists of of 128 \cus. Each \cu executes a
BFAST matching process, which is used to find potential DNA sequence
alignments. The scenario requires the following input data: 1.9\,GB
for the reference genome and index files, and 170\,MB for each
\textit{short read} file, i.\,e.\ the file generated by the DNA
sequencing machine. For this configuration a total of 128 read files
(one per CU) are used.

% \jhanote{The numbers don't add up!! 32 files of 1.68GB is about
% 50GB!}\alnote{hopefully fixed. This was explaining the input data we had 
% (we only have 32 read files, ie. we reuse them}

In total, 128\,\cus are defined and submitted to the
\texttt{Compute\-Data\-Service}. Each BFAST \cu requires 1 core;
depending on the resource a different number of cores may be assigned
for each BFAST \cu. Each \cu is associated with a
set of input files, which are staged by the application.

% each \cu.  

% \jhanote{how does his different from
%   pre-staging?}\alnote{refined. The difference is whether the
%   middleware or the app needs to do it.}

\subsubsection*{Experimental Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:perf_perf-bfast-bj} shows the results of the
experiments. In addition to the runtime ($T_r$) we
measured %the queuing time ($T_q$), the
time to transfer input files ($T_s$), and the actual runtime
$T_c$. $T_c$ also includes the overhead of the pilot. 
%which is usually ~10\,\% of the overall runtime. 
\jhanote{I'm not sure I understand
  this. What aspect of the pilot contributes 10\%. Why?} \alnote{I removed
this the number since it was specific to the BJ experiments and it is
not visible in the graphs.}

% Staging
% both
% pilot-external, i.\,e.\ queuing system (PBS, Torque, Condor) waiting
% times, as well as \pilot-internal waiting times.

% BFAST PERFORMANcE

For each \cu, the reference genome, the index files and one read file need to
be staged (1.9\,GB) -- which consumes the most significant part of the overall
runtime. In particular, on the HPC clusters, the staging quickly becomes a
bottleneck due to the fact that all \cus share the incoming bandwidth. Also,
fluctuation of the bandwidth in this scenario leads to a high failure rate. As
seen in B3, the staging time can be optimized by distributing the \cus to two
machines. Generally, the performance of BFAST is heavily dependent on the
available I/O bandwidth. Both the index and read files need to be loaded into
memory. Trestles (XSEDE) and India/Sierra (FG) have shared network filesystems
(Lustre for Trestles, NFS for India), which are utilized by all jobs running
on these machines -- the collective performance of multiple BFAST \cu thus
degrades significantly with the available I/O bandwidth, e.\,g.\ if a large
number of jobs access the filesystem concurrently (the runtime on India is
likely due to the usage of NFS about 20\,\% slower than on the other machine).
On EGI and OSG, the BFAST \cu performs best. This can mainly be attributed to
the use of local storage.

% Queuing Time
% \alnote{to refine: queuing time not part of the diagram anymore}
% Another factor is $T_q$. In B1 and B2, $T_q$ is very low and mainly
% caused by BJ internal sub-job queueing. In B3, $T_q$ is primarily
% caused by the launch of the 128 worker agents -- each of these agents
% needs to be submitted and started via the gLite WMS; on each node, a
% DIANE worker agent must be downloaded, installed and started. In
% total, $T_q$ for each \cu was $\sim$50\,min (in cmp. $T_q$ for BJ on
% India was $\sim$9\,min). Thus, even if $T_s$ is not considered, $T_r$
% is $\sim$2.3 times longer on EGI (DIANE) than on FutureGrid (BJ).
% The
% unpredictability of $T_q$ also contributes to the higher deviation in
% $T_r$. On OSG, $T_q$ is $\sim$12 minutes, comparable to $T_q$ on
% XSEDE::Kraken.


% File Staging
% In B1 and B2, no file staging is used. On EGI and OSG resources, however, no
% shared filesystem is available; thus, files need to be transferred to the
% executing system for B3 and B4. 


% If file
% staging is not considered, OSG shows the best performance. \amnote{The amounts
% of data differ from what was stated earlier.} \amnote{The runtime should not be
% 4 to 5 times longer because of staging, if staging consumes 50\% of it -- that
% would give a factor of 2}\alnote{The runtime compared to the Kraken runtime.}




% Despite the fact that BigJob has been also installed
% with each run, it shows a significant lower startup time of 73\,sec, i.\,e.\
% about 50\,sec less than DIANE. Additionally, we also observed a runtime
% overhead of about 25\,sec for the DIANE scenario. This overhead is likely
% caused by the additional agents required. While BigJob utilizes one BJ-Agent
% on the resource, DIANE currently requires the spawning of one worker agent per
% \cu that must be executed in parallel. While the Pilot-API marshals these
% differences, i.\,e.\ while the API remains the same for both PJ frameworks, a
% light performance overhead remains observable.


% This
% can mainly be attributed to the better performance of the OSG resource, which is
% particularly visible in the BFAST runtimes, which are on average 40\,\% shorter
% than on LONI. Further, due to the lack of SAGA on OSG, BJ is deployed with the
% Redis c\&c sub-system, which shows a significantly better performance than the
% Advert Service (see section~\ref{sec:pj_performance}).

% \jhanote{What are we trying to say here?  Is it that although the API
%   is similar, semantics of implementation and execution remain
%   different, and that TROY backend handles them?}\alnote{well said}


% This part also sounds too engine-like
% Dynamic
% applications can utilize the elasticity of the TROY resource pool
% e.\,g.\ to improve the time-to-completion and/or to scale the accuracy
% of their computations.

\subsection{PJ Framework Interoperability}
\label{sec:experiment-interop}

In principal, two different kinds of interoperability between
\pilotjobs and infrastructure exist: the first is the usage of BJ in
conjunction with different SAGA adaptors and infrastructures, and the
second is PJ framework interoperability, i.\,e.\ the usage of
different PJ frameworks via the Pilot-API. In configuration C1 we
utilize SAGA-based interoperability by running BigJob concurrently on
FutureGrid:India and XSEDE:Trestles. C2 and C3 show PJ
framework interoperability by concurrently running BigJob and DIANE on
FutureGrid:India and EGI as well as Condor and BigJob on OSG and
XSEDE:QueenBee. For all scenarios, we run the same BFAST application
described in \S\ref{sec:fg-xsede-osg-egi} with 64\,\cus on each
infrastructure, i.\,e.\ in total 128\,\cus.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{../perf/interop/128-bfast-interop-with-staging.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{PJ Framework Interoperability:} Runtime of
        128 BFAST \cus on different infrastructures. \cus are
        equally distributed across the two infrastructures. The performance 
		heavily depends on the available bandwidths to the resources, which 
		determines the time required for file transfers. \jhanote{Why
            are the numbers being added? Aren't the runs concurrent on
            the two infrastructures?}\alnote{refined}}
	\label{fig:perf_interop_128-bfast-interop}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:perf_interop_128-bfast-interop} shows the results of
the interoperability tests. In C1, one \pilot is submitted to Kraken
and one to India. Files are pre-staged before the run. Needless to
say, the overall runtime is determined by the slower
resources. Consistent with previous results the \pilot on India
finished before the \pilot on Kraken. However, $T_r$ of the
distributed run improved about 6\,\% compared to a Kraken only run
mainly due to the usage of the faster India resource for half of the
\cus.

% However, the runtime of
% the scenario is also about 20\,\% slower than running on India only.

%\jhanote{should this scenario number be different?} \alnote{sorry,
%  just moved this paragraph down from B} 

The middle bar in figure~\ref{fig:perf_interop_128-bfast-interop} shows C2 and
demonstrates that two PJ frameworks can be utilized concurrently using the
Pilot-API. As in the previous scenarios, the overall performance heavily
depends on the time required for staging the files (for scenarios C2 and C3 we
estimated the staging times based on previous measurements). Further, some
performance overhead is induced by the distributed coordination necessary
particular in case C2 where the BJ manager is located in the EU in a high
latency environment. All communication is conducted via a Redis instance
deployed on FG, while the BJ manager is deployed on EGI; thus, for each \cu
several cross-atlantic roundtrips are necessary.
Finally, C3 (right bars in figure~\ref{fig:perf_interop_128-bfast-interop})
shows the result of the OSG and XSEDE::QB run. Since QueenBee is an older
XSEDE machine, $T_r$ on this machine is much longer than $T_r$ on OSG despite
the necessity of file staging.

\subsection{Data Management and Pilot-Data}
\label{sec:experiment-pilotdata}

A particular challenge when running data-intensive tasks is the management of
data. We investigate different data management scenarios: (D1) the usage of 
application-level file staging without PD, (D2) the usage of PD with the SSH 
plugin, and (D3) the usage of PD with Globus Online. For these experiments, we
utilize the Trestles (XSEDE). The input files are located on a remote 
machine: Quarry (IU) for D1, Lonestar (TACC) for D2 and D3.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\upp
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../perf/sc/pd-128cus.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Pilot-Data Performance:} Using Pilot-Data the staging 
	time can be significantly improved due to a reduction of the overall data 
	transfer volume from 128 $\cdot$ 1.9\,GB to about 24\,GB (1.9\,GB + 128 
	$\cdot$ 170\,MB). Further, Globus Online utilizes with GridFTP a more 
	efficient transfer protocol.\up\up}
	\label{fig:perf_sc_download-concurrent-cus}
\end{figure}

As previously alluded (see Figure~\ref{fig:perf_interop_128-bfast-interop}),
file staging quickly becomes a bottleneck with a sufficiently high number of
CUs as all CUs share the incoming bandwidth. Also, I/O contention on the
shared file systems leads to an increasing compute time.
Figure~\ref{fig:perf_sc_download-concurrent-cus} shows that with an increasing
number of CUs, the naive way of moving files (D1), which is reflected in a
runtime of $>$4 hours for 128 CUs. While the download time increases linearly
with the number of CUs, the compute time remains almost constant at ~15\,min.

\jhanote{why the further reduction with GO?}\alnote{this was just some dummy
data with 1 CU. Now the figure contains the most current data}

There are two options to address this issue: either scale-out the computation
to multiple resource (see C3) or optimize data transfers using \pilotdata.
Using \pilotdata the overall amount of data that needs to be transferred for
the 128 CU scenario is reduced from 243\,GB (i.\,e.\ 128\,\cus times 1.9\,GB
data for the reference genome, index files and 1 read file) to 24\,GB (a
single transfer of the reference genome and index files and 1 read file per
\cu, i.\,e.\ 128 times 170\,MB ). The staging times in D2 and D3 are
comparable: Both SSH and Globus Online show some overhead compared to a plain
HTTP-based transfer, the lower amount of data leads to a significant
improvement. Globus Online shows a better performance than SSH mainly due to
the more efficient GridFTP transfer protocol.

can't see where B1/B2 and C1/C2 etc are defined}\alnote{Bx and Cx are defined

\jhanote{This paragraph is misplaced} \alnote{propose to merge in
  conclusion} In summary, the Pilot-API enables the usage of a diverse
set of distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures via a unified
API. As shown, the Pilot-API does not represent a barrier to
scalability, but provides the ability to overcome scalability
limitations of certain infrastructure caused e.\,g.\ by IO, memory,
and/or bandwidth bottlenecks. By using the capabilities of the
Pilot-API, i.\,e.\ the decoupling of workload submission from resource
assignment, applications can scale-out on multiple and possibly
heterogeneous resources in a flexible way. While scale-out introduces
some overheads (e.\,g.\ in particular for data-intensive applications,
large amounts data need to be moved), it enables application to
improve performance, e.\,g.\ by offloading parts of the computation to
a faster resource (see C1), and to scale its problem set, e.\,g.\ by
utilizing more resources at the same time.

\note{Future Work: optimizations (parallel queuing and transferring)}


\jhanote{This will probably have to go due to space: In summary, the
  Pilot-API enables applications to utilize a dynamic resource pool
  consisting of resources of different infrastructures, e.\,g.\ EGI
  and FutureGrid, but also XSEDE resources, at large-scales hitherto
  unattainable.}



% \input{bigdata}
% 
% Both BigJob and BigData define similar elements that can be mapped to
% each other. Nevertheless, compute and data model sometimes require a
% different treatment.  The extended TROY (an implementation of the
% extended P* Model) will optimize data- and computing according to a
% set of defined affinities and policies.

% BJ and BD encapsulate cross-cutting properties across data and
% computation. 

% With the maturing of both models and
% implementations, we expect that both the PJ and PD model converge in
% the future.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion-future-work}

\jhanote{Ole: Please Please Please put down an analysis of why an API
  is not enough and the deployment challenges that remain. In other
  words, the API is a necessary starting point, but not a sufficient
  point.}

% The P* model was used to demonstrate
% We established PJ and PD as abstractions for supporting dynamic
% execution by decoupling workload and resource
% assignment/scheduling. 

% they share different important properties with respect to the commonly
% used communication and coordination schemes.

% \alnote{Add discussion on limitations of API - address these
%   limitations in a common runtime system.}

The primary intellectual contribution of this work has been the
development of the P* Model, the mapping of P* elements to PJ
frameworks such as DIANE and Condor-G/Glide-in and the design and
development of the Pilot-API -- that reflects the P* elements and
characteristics.  
 
The P* Model provides a common abstract model for describing and
characterizing Pilot-abstractions.  We validate the P* Model by
demonstrating that the most widely used PJ frameworks, viz., DIANE and
Condor-G/Glide-in can be compared, contrasted and analyzed using this
analytical framework.  Furthermore we demonstrate the use of the
Pilot-API -- which provides a common access layer to different PJ
frameworks, with multiple PJ frameworks over distributed production
cyberinfrastructure, such as XSEDE, OSG, EGI and FutureGrid. The
Pilot-API also enables the concurrent use of multiple PJ frameworks,
thus providing interoperability and extensibility.  Although the aim
of our experiments is the demonstration of the interoperable use of
hitherto distinct and disjoint \pilotjobs, in the process we highlight
the performance advantages that can emanate from the ability to
seamlessly distribute (I/O intensive) workloads in a scalable manner.

%The Pilot-API reflects the P* elements and characteristics, and
%provides a common access layer to different PJ framewors via a uniform
%API; 

% , i.\,e.\ the architecture and the communication and coordination
% schemes.\alnote{i.e. sub-clause can go} .  Building on the P* Model,
% the Pilot-API's design enables the easy exchange of PJ
% implementations, and also The Pilot-API functions as common access
% layer for different PJ frameworks, thus


% However, the SAGA inspired approach to the Pilot-API design and the
% leverage of the design and deployment experiences of SAGA, e.\,g.\ by
% moving the responsibility of correctly deployed grid-middleware to the
% resource providers and not the end-users, should be an effective
% solution. 

P* provides significant future development, research \& deployment
opportunities. We discuss one opportunity along each of these axes:
(i) Development and Extension: In order to overcome limitations of the
API-based approach we will develop a complete implementation of the P* Model
-- called TROY (Tiered Resource Overlay). TROY will provide deeper
integration of the Pilot-API via a semantic mapping of the P* elements
and characteristics to \pilotjob frameworks.  TROY will also provide a
unified -- compute and data, implementation of P*, e.g., BigData
analogous to BigJob;  (ii) Research Issues: These developments and
extensions will also provide the basis to explore and reason on the
relative roles of system versus application-level scheduling,
heuristics for dynamic execution and the role of affinity; (iii)
Deployment and Uptake: The Pilot-API and TROY are/will be designed to
support production scale science on production infrastructure (as
demonstrated by the emphasis on production infrastructure in our
experimentation).  Our experience with fragile grid middleware and
infrastructures has taught us to appreciate the significance of the
ease of deployment and the need for robustness of tools and software
on heterogeneous distributed infrastructures.  TROY -- which embodies
the P* Model, is being designed with usability, reliability and
robustness as first-class considerations.

Our fundamental research has immense practical implications and
potential: Although current PJ frameworks collectively support
millions of tasks yearly on several production distributed
infrastructure, extensibility and interoperability remain significant
challenges~\cite{extenci}.  Given the increasing importance of
\pilotjobs and the challenges associated with distributed data
placement, our work which provides both a conceptual model and
practical solutions has the potential to improve this situation.  In
fact, it is a stated goal of our research to enhance the range of
applications and application usage-modes that will benefit from the
\pilot abstraction, by deeply integrating Pilot-API/P* and TROY
capabilities with multiple production infrastructures~\cite{bigjob_web}.





% On the basis of successful validation of the P* Model, we propose
% extensions to include data.  For example, presenting unified
% abstractions within the Pilot-API and

% Additionally we aim to provide explicit support for advanced dynamic
% execution modes and 

% In summary, we will use existing and emerging capabilities of TROY to
% support the efficient and scalable solution of many scientific
% applications that involve multiple independent tasks.\alnote{just one sentence - can be merged with paragraph above.}

% It is not possible to anticipate all of the tools and abstractions
% that distributed applications will need down the road. Changes in
% infrastructure and application requirements cannot be predicted. For
% this reason, tools must provide open interfaces to enable more easy
% integration and interoperation with other tools. Whether this can be
% best achieved by new extensible tools or “tool orchestration” or a
% tool “framework” is an open question. This, of course, does not
% preclude the internal evolution of existing tools to implement new
% abstractions, but just this is not enough in our view.
