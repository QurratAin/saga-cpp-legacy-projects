  - reviewer comment about missing PJ definition:
    - make our working definition on page one more explicit/visible/...;
    - after presenting the model, come up with a more refined definition
      based on that model

 
  - don't talk about troy engine/adaptors/cpi, *just* API which is
    consistent with the P* model
    - fig 2: top stuff goes, put try API directly on BigJob, Diane, ...
      (similar to fig. 6, reconcile both)
   
  - TODO JHA: see rebuttal: theoretical framework

  - TODO ANDRE/JHA: we do not well define the SAGA approach to interop,
    which is (additional to borrowed job model elements) what we mean
    when saying that TROY is a SAGA inspired/aligned/...
