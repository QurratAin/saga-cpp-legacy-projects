Pilot-Abstractions for MapReduce-based Applications on Clouds

The data generated by scientific applications is experiencing an
exponential growth. Addressing the consequences of this exponential
growth has spawned the field of BigData. Given that data and compute
resources cannot always be co-located, an important component of the
BigData problem is how to utilize the efficient use of distributed
resources so as to make meaningful sense of all of the data produced.

In recent work we showed how MapReduce can be used to efficiently
process distributed data across a distributed set of resources.
Pilot-MapReduce (PMR) is a flexible, infrastructure-independent
runtime environment for MapReduce. PMR is based on Pilot-abstractions
for compute (Pilot-Jobs) and data (Pilot-Data). Pilot-Jobs are used to
couple the map phase computation to the nearby source data, and
Pilot-Data is used to move intermediate data using parallel data
transfers to the reduce computation phase.

In this work, we show how Pilot abstractions and PMR enable the
efficient processing of distributed data on heterogeneous distributed
infrastructure including different academic and commercial clouds
(e.g. Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine and FutureGrid). We
investigate the effectiveness of PMR based applications on cloud
infrastructure for different next-generation gene sequencing
applications.  The flexible runtime provided by the Pilot-abstraction,
helped establish PMR's effectiveness for distributed data scenarios on
clusters that are nodes on a WAN. Given the different network
characteristics within clouds, we investigate whether performance
determinants for clusters, are valid for clouds.  We analyze different
resource and MapReduce configurations, such as both hierarchical and
distributed MapReduce using an NGS application.  Our analysis covers
multiple scenarios exposing the different (typical) trade-offs: e.g.,
the overhead times in spawning virtual machines, different storage
types, geographic distribution, and establishes that the Pilots
provide a powerful abstraction for Clouds as well.
