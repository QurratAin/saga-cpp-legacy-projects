Introduction
	- What is ECSS?
	- What is SAGA?
	- What is BigJob?
	- Scientific Applications

Background / Motivation (??)
	- What is ECSS?
	- Brief outline and science objectives of two ECSS projects
		- Charles Laughton? Tom Bishop? Rutgers chemists?

SAGA and BigJob on XSEDE
	- Software Description of SAGA
	- Software Description of BigJob

CSA Deployment on XSEDE Machines
	- Table of CSA deployments, supported/tested/documented adaptors, list MD capabilities?
	- List setbacks encountered
	- List developments emerging from this process
		- Pradeep's new adaptors.
		-
	- Testing and Documentation Process
		- Show how this is a team effort
		- BigJob deployment pipeline
			-Interaction with chemists to address their issues and formulate 				scripts to assist them with their research in fast turn around time

Initial Results
	- Show work from chemists (if available)
	- Applicability of BigJob to other applications beyond RE / chemists

Future Work
	- Further deployments
	- Replica exchange? File staging? 
	- Continued support for chemists
	- Do we want to get into pilot job stuff?
