Back when queen bee was running slower and I was using 384 processors:

384 CPUs 0.0529952 s/step 0.306685 days/ns

Now it's faster and I'm used 256 processors and the performance is:

256 CPUs 0.0506383 s/step 0.293045 days/ns

It's about the same for tezpur. I could run a more recent 384 processor job if it helps?
