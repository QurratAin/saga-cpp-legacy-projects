%\section{Results From Prior Awards}

% \jhanote{This should list out (i) prior awards and what they were for, (ii) scientific progress and understanding that arose and (ii) publications as a result of prior awards.}

% \jhanote{Yaakoub/Joohyun: Our award/project number for last years TRAC is MCB090174.
%   Please mention resource usage statistics, be sure to mention that we've used 100\% well before
%   the expiry. Mention allocation swapping between machines}

% \jhanote{Publications arising from clast TRAC: (i) Project 1: JCTC and a publication on ABF are in the works; (ii) Riboswtich -- in addition to NAR, we have ECMLS and others (Joohyun to fix), (iii) UCL is listed in prior.tex so ok, (iv) Project 4, TeraGrid-talk, DEISA Interop talk, and publication in process, but also reference Cybertools publications -- ccgrid and others}

This group has multiple publications arising from prior LONI Awards
(2011, and earlier). We provide progress updates along three primary
tracks:

{\it Computational Biology:} Using previous LONI allocations, we have
performed multiple MD simulations for the SAM-I riboswtich study. Most
recent publication for this strand of work has just been accepted for
the Journaml of Molecular Biology~\cite{jmb2012}. Earlier publications
included -- Ref~\cite{ecmls10,ecmls10_ccpe10}, as well a recently
published journal article in the prestigious Nucleic Acids
Research\cite{SAM-I-NAR2009} (Impact Factor $>$ 7.0). Further
publications are planned.

Another strand of research that has been supported by these
allocations is the personalized medicine work with Prof. Coveney.  For
example, Ref.~\cite{tg-vph-interop}.

{\it Cyberinfrastructure Development:} We have also used LONI
allocation for multiple computer science developments and experiments,
namely the development and testing of the SAGA-based Pilot-Jobs,
including accepted publications at TeraGrid'11 conference, such as
those related to the Distributed Application Runtime Environment have
been published. Ref~\cite{dare-ecmls11, dare-tg11}.

{\it Computer Science:} A very significant publication that has been
published by the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
(Ref~\cite{async_repex11}), was supported extensively by LONI grants.
In this paper, three different classes of replica-exchange (RE)
algorithms are developed and their scaling behaviour determined. RE
represent a class of algorithms that involve a large number of
loosely-coupled ensembles, and are thus amenable to using distributed
resources. We develop a framework for RE which supports different
replica pairing (synchronous vs.  asynchronous) and exchange
coordination mechanisms (centralised vs.  decentralised) and which can
use a range of production cyberinfrastructure concurrently.
