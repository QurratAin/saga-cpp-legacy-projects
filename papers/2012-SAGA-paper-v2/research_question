Is there a research question SAGA is the answer to, and if so, what is it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAGA has not been *designed* as an answer to a research question, but rather as
an answer to an engineering challenge (the challenge was the insurmountable
difficulty to scale the implementation of distributed applications on DCI).

The question remains, nevertheless, if SAGA is a answer to an underlying systems
research problem.  One sub-question is: Is SAGA exposing abstractions of
underlying systems, even if SAGA, initially, did not consider the abstraction of
DCI systems as an important objective?
