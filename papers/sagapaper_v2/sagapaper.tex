\section{Introduction}
 \todo{SJ}
 \label{intro}

  Intro

 \begin{verbatim}
   - grand intellectual challenges of designing DCIs
     - how to design infrastructures to bridge gap
     - what is role of abstractions/interfaces in general, and for
       SAGA
       - interface necessary, but sufficient?
       - should be sufficient, if fully functional (contract)
       - but what are the challenges of providing a functional interface?
       - at the end deep integration!
       - from there follows design, limitations
         (possibly goes partially into conclusions)
 \end{verbatim}

Developing versus Deployment versus Using

For context: it is still very difficult to develop a distributed
application that can use O(1000) processors, transfer/handle O(100) GB
data and use O(10) arbitrarily chosen sites, repeated over 10
arbitrary chosen days. The only science projects that can do so
currently are Big Science projects, with very large teams and levels
of effort.  Individual PIs/scientists are unable to do so, but there
are many who clamor and need to be able to do so This fundamental
mismatch between requirement of DCA and capabilities of DCI is one of
the intellectual problems that we are trying to address.

A distributed application has some unique challenges: a distributed
application/developer has to reason about the environment that the
application will execute in, has to make assumptions about the runtime
availability, and has to assume a failure model that transcends
complete knowledge of the application or even predicates it upon
knowledge of a system/resource.  Whereas the choice of tools will
always be influenced by soft factors, the challenge for us is to think
of abstractions that enable the developer to reason about the above
hard factors, and not just the tools, services and capabilities.

 \begin{verbatim}
   - plethora of point-wise solutions vs. end-to-end solutions
   - trends and requirements
   - elaborate on introduction

  capabilities}

 - role for integrated tools and frameworks


 \subsection{The Interface Standards Landscape}
 \label{interface_landscape}

  Intro. OGF, DRMAA, SAGA, SAGA Extensions\\

 \subsection{The Simple API for Grid Applications}

  \begin{verbatim}
     -> Requirements / Design Objectives
     -> How approached
     -> Lessons Learned
  
     -> be relevent to large user base and longish time scales
     -> good scoping API, use cases, requests, common practice
     -> still too large, apps are moving, no 1st principle apps,
        stability vs. agility, poorly understood use cases, moving targets, 

  \end{verbatim}





\section{How to implement SAGA to meet challenges of Section 3}
\label{saga_impls}

 Intro. jSAGA, JavaSAGA, SAGA-C++, Bliss, DESHL(?)

 \subsection{Design Principles}

  \begin{verbatim}
    - design objective: implement SAGA to meet role/challenges of
      previous section --> overarching goal: Manage Complexities
  
     -> Requirements / Design Objectives
     -> How approached
     -> Lessons Learned
  
     -> Manage Heterogeneity
     -> portable, adaptor based
     -> deployment vs coding, 'semantic equivalence'
  
     -> easy to deploy / easy to integrate
     -> components, containment, loose coupling
     -> tight coupling, leaky abstractions
  
     -> extensibility
     -> adaptors, packages, higher level abstraction
     -> adaptors: hard to enforce semantic coherence
        packages: ok (mod impl)
        HLA:      hindered by impl deficiencies
  
     -> sustainable production code in academic env
     -> community involvement, vendor uptake/buy-in, small code base,
        standardization (see Zakopane paper)
     -> integration with ecosystem (technical and social), 
  
     ->
