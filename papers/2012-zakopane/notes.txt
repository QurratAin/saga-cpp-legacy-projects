-----------------------------

  - When:  Wednesday, October 12, 2011, 22:00 CET
           Friday,    October 14, 2011, 21:00 CET
           Sunday,    October 16, 2011, 22:00 CET
  - Who:   Andre, Shantenu, AndreL, Mark, Ole, Sharath
  - What:

  - critical:
    - implementation / boost / deployment
      - API: 
        - use case selection 'biased', old
        - simple, but not simple enough?
        - ? overlapping / competing standards (DRMAA / SAGA / GridRPC)
        - posix layer like approach: mission accomplished.  What now?
        - SAGA API as approach seems well accepted, and proven valid
          and viable
      - resource providers and MW developers were less interested than
        end users... - why?
    - SAGA standard: 
      - useful in uptake and acceptance
      - standardization is the 'easy' part (we know how to do it)
      - pro-activevs reactive: community blurs....
    - academia = solid software?  
      - relevant question? software vs. project
      - don't pinpoint as software deliverable!
      - is an economic question, change coming
    - how does SAGA project depend on SAGA software quality?
    - first step: disect project components
      - DONE ALL: propose definitions?
    - how do we measure success of the project:
      - Shantenu will talk about it for at least 10 years ;-)
      - uptake! (on standard / impl / user level)
      - DRMAA model worked - why not for SAGA?
      - wider scope, many things need to align, which did not
      - define community standard (DRMAA is not)
    - are APIs the goal?
      - original end user: ab-initio app developer
        now: tool / framework developers
        - will that evolution cont.?
        - do we give the right tools to our current users?
      - churn of access layer to DCI seems a constant
        -> homogenisation is important
        -> to enable innovation on higher levels
      - whatever provides fixed and well defined access layer works
        (APIs, command line, frameworks, ...)
    - churn is perspective-biased
      - happens on all levels
      - only hurts below (and is important above)
      - right abstraction layering help


    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    - topic: evolution of SAGA landscape, an in particular the SAGA
             project
      - what is scope here for next decade (intrinsic, our SAGA project)
        - standard
          relation to other specs
        - impl
          engine, bindings, adaptors, packaging, testing, ...
        - higher level
          bigjob, portals

      - before next decade: what is state right now?
        - includes paragraph on state of DCI (software + hardware +
          provisioning + ...)
        - state / overview of user community

      - roadmap:
        - extrinsic influences intrinsic
        foreach (extrinsic)
        {
          vision of extrinsic evolution -> influence on our SAGA project
        }
    --------------------------------------------------------------------


    - DONE ANDRE: create LaTeX template and assign people to sections
    - STCI proposal intro would need to define barrier to be addressed by
      future project, possibly do the same for the paper
    - touch back on Wednesday, sync on Sunday


Retro: extrinsic, background of state
State: intrinsic

Notes from Andre Luckow
  Advert API: 
  - How to reconcile an existing approach as advert api with the 
    changing landscape?  Change of landscape in the last 6-7 years 
    - changed capabilities provided by companies (e.g. AWS, Google, Redis, ZeroMQ) 
    - SAGA relationship in comparison to this commercial developments 
    - trends in academia and commercial environments 
    - original space: 
      - developer of first principal applications 
      - vs. framework developers 
      - vs. usage in access layers (science gateways) 
    - original space is occupied by infrastructure provider 
    - nowadays with MR, Globus Online the level of abstraction much higher 
    - infrastructure provider (such XSEDE) should run advert service .
      Should one do a message api in place of the availability of a 
      commercial solution?  
  - only very bad apis around current state of SAGA 
  - whether Software is funded or not introduction \& scope 
  - what is our saga project: api, implementation, framework talking about trends?  
  - trend toward standardization or opposite 
  - unambiguous 
  - role of virtualization in production distributed infrastructure 
  - for what infrastructure should we harden our binding?  
  - if standards track is not attractive anymore, this has consequences to access layer 
  - change in the role of data!  
  - consequence of of data 
  - how should SAGA respond to the data-paradigm: 
  - programming abstraction: pilot data 
  - dynamic, distributed data
