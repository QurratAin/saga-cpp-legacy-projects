 Evolution of SAGA landscape, and in particular of the SAGA project.\\

\alnote{
Advert API:
- How to reconcile an existing approach as advert api with the changing landscape?
Change of landscape in the last 6-7 years
- changed capabilites provided by companies (e.g. AWS, Google, Redis, ZeroMQ)
- SAGA relationship in comparison to this commercial developments
- trends in academia and commercial environments
- original space:
     - developer of first principal applications
     - vs. framework developers
     - vs. usage in access layers (science gateways)
- original space is occupied by infrastructure provider
- nowadays with MR, Globus Online the level of abstraction much higher
- infrastructure provider (such XSEDE) should run advert service 
Should one do a message api in place of the availability of a commercial solution?
- only very bad apis around

- whether Software is funded or not
introduction \& scope
- what is our saga project: api, implementation, framework
talking about trends?
- trend toward standardization or opposite
- unambiguous
- role of virtualization in production distributed infrastructure
- for what infrastructure should we harden our binding?
- if standards track is not attractive anymore, this has consequences to access layer
- change in the role of data!
- consequence of of data
- how should SAGA respond to the data-paradigm:
     - programming abstraction: pilot data
     - dynamic, distributed data
}

 "Panta Rhei" -- that phrase is ever so true for human technology.
 The last decade has seen that confirmed for distributed computing as
 for any other field of computing or technology in general.  While it
 is notoriously hard and error prone to predict the future, we dare a
 biased and limited (aka fokused) glimpse into the expected evolution
 of our specific area of interest: programming abstractions for
 distributed scientific computing.  We have been trying to enrich and
 support activities in that area for the past decade, most notably by
 defining and implementing the Simple API for Grid Applications
 (SAGA), which spawned an interesting and agile ecosystem of
 distributed programming abstractions.

 The original target scope for SAGA, however, almost disappeared -- we
 have not seen as many 1st principle distributed applications as
 expected, by far.  Instead, we have seen that application frameworks
 on the one (upper) end, and application oriented DCI capabilities on
 the (lower) end, have increasingly and successfully been used by our
 target community over the past years.  At the same time, the hurdles
 for application *users* and framework coders are still significant,
 and many of the complaints voiced by those communities do not differ
 very much from what we heard a decade ago, when they initially
 prompted our Grid Application Toolkit activities in the GridLab
 project.

 With that background, we will try to discuss the roadmap for our SAGA
 based activities, in respect to standardization, implementation, and
 integration.  We will focus our discussion on three different aspects
 of the SAGA landscape: the SAGA standardization 

 \nind
 - what is scope here for next decade (intrinsics, what is our SAGA project)\\
 --- standard, incl. relation to other specs (\todo{AM, SJ} )\\
 --- impl - engine, bindings, adaptors, packaging, testing, ... (\todo{OW})\\
 --- higher level - bigjob, portals (\todo{AL, SM, MS})\\
      

 \subsection{Re-Active versus Pro-Active Evolution \todo{AM}}

  The SAGA project historically tried to find a balance between a
  reactive and proactive approach: while the initial GAT and SAGA API
  efforts have clearly been a reaction to end user demands, the SAGA
  evolution has also significantly been driven by the attempt to
  predict DCI evolution and cater to expected upcoming application
  programming paradigms.  For example, the SAGA Job API is reactively
  defined, and provides a rendering of concepts which are well known
  in distributed computing.  On the other hand, the SAGA Advert API is
  not directly mappable to previously established concepts, but is
  rather an expression of functionality which the SAGA project group
  \I{expected} to be useful for its target application and user
  community.

  \todo{How to reconcile pro-active APIs with reality later on?  See
  advert API $->$ redis/nosql; message API $->$ amqp, amazon queues
  etc.}
  
  We expect that the SAGA project will continue to try to find that
  balance, in the hope that the reactive components are sure to cater
  to \I{real} (vs. expected or hyped) technology development, and that
  the proactive components allow to stay close to the state of the
  art, and to avoid to become fossilized.  It must be noted, however,
  that in particular on implementation level, the proactive component
  is often very hard to justify, and chronically suffers from a lack
  of resources.


\section{State}

 \nind
 - previous decade: what is state right now? (extrinsics)\\
 --- state of DCI (software + hardware + provisioning + ...) (\todo{AM, SJ})\\
 
We need a redefinition of application. The "traditional" application that ran on people's desktop is still very present.
Because of scale the usage mode of these applications did change, but it didn't change the application themselves.
They are in most cases still black boxes that take input and create input.
Explicitly not distributed as a primary primitive.

 --- state / overview of user community (\todo{SJ})\\
 
 Growth of users and data volumes is coming from communities that didn't even exists 10 years ago.
 
 
 --- state of SAGA project in relation to/as caused by above (\todo{AM})

The abstraction level as developed by GAT / SAGA ended up not being used by the envisioned users.
Higher level of abstractions were developed to cater for that. Note that the fact that underlying standards exist is still very valuable to create good higher level abstractions.

More importantly, the shift from job centric to data centric e-science is not well represented in SAGA (or in any distributed infrastructure in general).

\section{Vision}

 \nind

 "The only thing we know about the future is that it is going to be
 different." -- Peter Drucker, 'Management: Tasks,
 Responsibilities, Practices' (1973), Part 1, Chapter 4\\ 

 % instead of prediction, discuss actual trends or
 % options/parameters (role of standards, role of virtualization,
 % role of access layers) 
 % 
 % how should SAGA respond to change in data paradigm

 - evolution of DCI $>>>$ influence on SAGA project\\
 --- evolution of Grids, Clouds (\todo{SJ, AM})\\
 --- evolution of middlewares (\todo{AM})\\
 --- evolution of national / international infrastructures (\todo{SJ})\\

"Three Worlds", the US, Europe and "the rest".
In Europe, in the last decade the model has changed from a centrally managed Grid to a real on national borders distributed Grid.

 
 \nind
 - evolution of communities  $>>>$ influence on SAGA project\\
 --- evolution of applications (\todo{AL, SM, MS})\\
 
Basically no real evolution at all. Although much research has gone into programming paradigms for distributed computing, little of that runs in production.
 
 --- evolution of app domains (\todo{AL, SJ, MS})\\
 
 New science domains, which different kind of characteristic.
 Combination of simulations and data analysis. A lot of progress in science fields that create high volumes of data.
Data, data, data.
More tight coupling to systems from the science domain.
 
 --- evolution of usage modes (\todo{AL, SJ})\\
 
 Research moved to desks. Data analysis has became even more than 10 years ago a primary task of researchers.
 Data analysis in more phases of research cycle, see e-science paradigm.
Semantics.
Provenance and reproducible science.
  
 --- evolution of project contributions (\todo{SM, OW})\\
 
 --- evolution of programming abstractions (level) (\todo{SJ, AL, MS})\\
 
No real uptake of distributed applications, but much progress on glue layers to link legacy applications together.
Implicit parallellisation on data input.
