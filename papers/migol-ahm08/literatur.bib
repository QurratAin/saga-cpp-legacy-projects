@techreport{Vaidya94b,
	Abstract = {{This report deals with the design and evaluation of a
 ``two-level'' failure recovery scheme for distributed systems.  In
 our previous work we motivated a ``two-level'' recovery approach that
 tolerates the more probable failures with a low overhead, and less
 probable failures with possibly higher overhead. The two-level
 approach can achieve a smaller overhead as compared to traditional
 recovery schemes. The contributions of this report are summarized
 below:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item We present and evaluate a ``two-level'' recovery scheme that is
   suitable for a network of workstations, each workstation having a
   local disk. The recovery scheme presented in the report can
   tolerate transient processor failures with a low overhead, while
   other failures require a larger overhead.  The report presents
   analysis of the average (expected) task completion time using the
   proposed scheme.  This scheme has been implemented on a
   workstation cluster. Our analysis indicates that the proposed
   two-level recovery scheme can achieve better performance as
   compared to existing ``one-level'' recovery schemes.
 \item The report also evaluates the impact of checkpoint latency on the
   performance of the recovery scheme. To our knowledge, no analysis
   of the performance impact of checkpoint latency has been carried
   out previously.
 \item Experimental measurements of checkpoint latency and checkpoint
   overhead for four applications are presented.
 \end{itemize}

	Abstract = {{<B>An eye-opening look at the new computer revolution and the coming transformation of our economy, society, and culture.</B><BR><BR>A hundred years ago, companies stopped producing their own power with steam engines and generators and plugged into the newly built electric grid. The cheap power pumped out by electric utilities not only changed how businesses operated but also brought the modern world into existence. Today a similar revolution is under way. Companies are dismantling their private computer systems and tapping into rich services delivered over the Internet. This time it's computing that's turning into a utility. The shift is already remaking the computer industry, bringing new competitors like Google to the fore and threatening traditional stalwarts like Microsoft and Dell. But the effects will reach much further. Cheap computing will ultimately change society as profoundly as cheap electricity did. In this lucid and compelling book, Nicholas Carr weaves together history, economics, and technology to explain why computing is changing\&\#151;and what it means for all of us.}},

@phdthesis{fielding00,
	Abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.

Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.

This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web.

REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

This technology seeks an active strengthening of a military mission, rather than protecting its network infrastructure using static defensive measures such as network security, intrusion sensors, and firewalls. Computational resiliency involves the dynamic use of replication, guided by mission policy, to achieve intrusion tolerance so that even undetected attacks do not cause mission failure; however, it goes further to dynamically regenerate replication in response to an IW attack, allowing the level of system assurance to be restored and maintained. Replicated structures are protected through several techniques such as camouflage, dispersion, and layered security policy.

	Abstract = {The combination of grid technology and Web services has produced an attractive platform for deploying distributed applications: grid services, as represented by the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) and its Globus toolkit implementation. As the use of grid services grows in popularity, tolerating failures becomes increasingly important. This work addresses the problem of building a reliable and highly-available grid service by replicating the service on two or more hosts using the primary-backup approach. The primary goal is to evaluate the ease and efficiency with which this can be done, by first designing a primary-backup protocol using OGSI, and then implementing it using Globus to evaluate performance implications and tradeoffs. We compared three implementations: one that makes heavy use of the notification interface defined in OGSI, one that uses standard grid service requests instead of notification, and one that uses low-level socket primitives. T
he overall conclusion is that, while the performance penalty of using Globus primitives - especially notification - for replica coordination can be significant, the OGSI model is suitable for building highly-available services and it makes the task of engineering such services easier.},

	Abstract = {Grid computing emerges as effective technologies to couple geographically distributed resources and solve large-scale computational problems in wide area networked. The fault tolerance is a significant and complex issue in grid computing systems. Various techniques have been investigated to detect and correct faults in distributed computing systems. Unreliable fault detection is one of the most effective techniques. Globus as a grid middleware manages resources in a wide area network. The Globus fault detection service uses the well-known techniques based on unreliable fault detectors to detect and report component failures. However, more powerful techniques are required to detect and correct both system-level and application-level faults in a grid system, and a convenient toolkit is also needed to maintain the consistency in the grid. A fault-tolerant grid platform (FTGP) based on an unreliable fault detector and the Globus fault detection service is presented
 in this paper. The platform offers effective strategies in such three aspects as grid key components, user tasks, and high-level applications.},

	Abstract = {A grid consists of high-end computational, storage, and network resources that, while known a priori, are dynamic with respect to activity and availability. Efficient scheduling of requests to use grid resources must adapt to this dynamic environment while meeting administrative policies. In this paper, we describe a framework called SPHINX that can administrate grid policies, and schedule complex and data intensive scientific applications. We present experimental results for several scheduling strategies that effectively utilize the monitoring and job-tracking information provided by SPHINX. These results demonstrate that SPHINX can effectively schedule work across a large number of distributed clusters that are owned by multiple units in a virtual organization in a fault-tolerant way in spite of the highly dynamic nature of the grid and complex policy issues. The novelty lies in use of effective monitoring of resources and job execution tracking in making scheduling decisions and fault-tolerance - something that is missed in today's grid environments. },

	Abstract = {Initial versions of MPI were designed to work efficiently on multi-processors which had very little job control and thus static process models. Subsequently forcing them to support a dynamic process model suitable for use on clusters or distributed systems would have reduced their performance. As current HPC collaborative applications increase in size and distribution the potential levels of node and network failures increase the need arises for new fault tolerant systems to be developed. Here we present a new implementation of MPI called FT-MPI that allows the semantics and associated modes of failures to be explicitly controlled by an application via a modified MPI API. Given is an overview of the FT-MPI semantics, design, example applications and some performance issues such as efficient group communications and complex data handling.},

	Abstract = {The generic, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of the grid requires a new from of failure recovery mechanism to address its unique requirements such as support for diverse failure handling strategies, separation of failure handling strategies from application codes, and user-defined exception handling. We here propose a grid workflow system (grid-WFS), a flexible failure handling framework for the grid, which addresses these grid-unique failure recovery requirements. Central to the framework is flexibility by the use of workflow structure as a high-level recovery policy specification. We show how this use of high-level workflow structure allows users to achieve failure recovery in a variety of ways depending on the requirements and constraints of their applications. We also demonstrate that this use of workflow structure enables users to not only rapidly prototype and investigate failure handling strategies, but also easily change them by simply modifying the encompassing workflow structure, while the application code remains intact. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our framework using a simulation, demonstrating the value of supporting multiple failure recovery techniques in grid systems to achieve high performance in the presence of failures.},

	Abstract = {MPI implementations that support the highest level of thread safety for user programs, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, are becoming widely available. Users often expect that different threads can execute independently and that the MPI implementation can provide the necessary level of thread safety with only a small overhead. The MPI Standard, however, requires only that no MPI call in one thread block MPI calls in other threads; it makes no performance guarantees. Therefore, some way of measuring an implementation's performance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of performance tests that are motivated by typical application scenarios. These tests cover the overhead of providing the MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE level of thread safety for user programs, the amout of concurrency in different threads making MPI calls, the ability to overlap communication with computation, and other features. We present performance results with this test suite on several platforms (Linux cluster, Sun and IBM SMPs) and MPI implementations (MPICH2, Open MPI, IBM, and Sun).},

	Abstract = {Parallelism in file systems is obtained by using several independent server nodes supporting one or more secondary storage devices. This approach increases the performance and scalability of the system, but a fault in one single node can make the whole system fail. In order to avoid this problem, data must be stored using some kind of redundant technique, so that it can be recovered in case of failure. Fault tolerance can be provided in I/O systems by using replication or RAID based schemes. However, most of the current systems apply the same technique of fault tolerant at disk or file system level.
This paper describes how fault tolerance support can be used by MPI applications based on PVFS version 2, as well-know parallel file system for clusters. This support can be applied to other parallel file systems with many benefits: fault tolerance at file level, flexible definition of new fault tolerance scheme, and dynamic reconfiguration of the fault tolerance policy.},

This paper introduces a new transport protocol in Open MPI implemented using the existing OpenFabrics Verbs API that exhibits efficient registered memory utilization. Several real-world applications were run at scale with the new protocol; results show that global network resource utilization efficiency increases, allowing increased scalability -- and larger problem sizes -- on clusters which can increase application performance in some cases.},

We are developing MetaLoRaS, an efficient two-level MetaScheduler for non-dedicated environments, which assigns PVM and MPI applications according to an estimation of the turnaround time in each particular cluster.
The main MetaScheduler goal is to minimize the average job turnaround time in a non-dedicated environment. The efficiency of MetaLoRaS depends on the prediction accuracy of the system and its ability to take decisions according to changes in local workload.
In this paper we present different Metascheduling techniques that take the dynamics of the local workload into account and compare their effects on system performance. We evaluate the prediction accuracy in relation to the low-level queues sizes. Finally, we analyze the relationship between prediction accuracy and system performance.},

	Abstract = {MPI-2's One-sided communication interface is being explored in scientific applications. One of the important operations in a one sided model is read-modify-write. MPI-2 semantics provide MPI_Put, MPI_Get and MPI_Accumulate operations which can be used to implement read-modify-write functionality. The different strategies yield varying performance benefits depending on the underlying one-sided implementation. We use HPCC Random Access benchmark which primarily uses read-modify-write operations as a case study for evaluating the different implementation strategies in this paper. Currently this benchmark is implemented based on MPI two-sided semantics. In this work we design and evaluate MPI-2 versions of the HPCC Random Access benchmark using one-sided operations. To improve the performance, we explore two different optimizations: (i) software based aggregation and (ii) hardware-based atomic operations. We evaluate our different approaches on an InfiniBand cluster. The software based aggregation outperforms the basic one sided scheme without aggregation by a factor of 4.38. The hardware based scheme shows an improvement by a factor of 2.62 as compared to the basic one sided scheme.},

This model is particularly appropriate for cases where there are multiple communication events for each synchronization and where the target memory locations are known by the source processes. In this paper, we describe a benchmark designed to illustrate the performance of RMA with multiple RMA operations for each synchronization, as compared with point-to-point communication. We measured the performance of this benchmark on several platforms (SGI Altix, Sun Fire, IBM S<mp, Linux cluster) and MPI implementations (SGI, Sun, IBM, MPICH2, Open MPI). We also investigated the effectiveness of the various optimization options specified by the MPI standard. Our results show that MPI RMA can provide substantially higher performance than point-to-point communication on some platforms, such as SGI Altix and Sun Fire. The results also show that many opportunities still exist for performance improvements in the implementation of MPI RMA.},

A common-sense expectation of performance is that an MPI function should perform no worse than a combination of other MPI functions that can implement the same functionality. In this paper, we formulate some performance requirements and conditions that good MPI implementations can be expected to fulfill by relating aspects of the MPI standard to each other. Such a performance formulation could be used by benchmarks and tools, such as SKaMPI and Perfbase, to automatically verify whether a given MPI implementation fulfills basic performance requirements.

	Abstract = {Fault-tolerant distributed systems are becoming more
                important but, in existing systems, maintaining the
                consistency of replicated data is quite expencive. The
                Totem single-ring protocol supports consistent
                concurrent operations by placing a total order on
                broadcast messages. This total order is derived from
                the sequence number in a token that circulates around
                a logical ring imposed on a set  of processors in a
                broadcast domain. The protocol handles reconfiguration
                of the system when processors fail and restart or the
                network partitions and remerges. Extended Virtual
                Synchrony ensures that processors deliver messages and
                configuration changes to the application in a
                consistent total order system-wide. An efficient flow
                control mechanism enables the Totem single-ring
                protocol to achieve message ordering rates
                significantly higher than the best prior total
                ordering protocols},

	Abstract = {Although Web-based information systems (WISs) have been widely used by enterprises to accomplish business tasks through the Internet, there is little research on designing a flexible access control and delegation model for WISs. In this paper, we design a user-to-user and role-to-role delegation model (called X-RDR model) for WISs. The authorization and delegation policies are encoded in XML and the granularity of control can be as small as a text-field or button. Additionally, the proposed model supports single-step delegation, multi-step delegation, multiple delegation, partial delegation, separation of duties, and cascading revocation. A prototype was also implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.},

	Abstract = {Divide-and-conquer is a well-suited programming paradigm for
parallel Grid applications. Our Satin system efficiently schedules the
fine-grained tasks of a divide-and-conquer application across multiple clusters
in a grid. To accomodate long-running applications, we present a fault-tolerance
mechanism for Satin that has negligible overhead during normal execution, while
minimizing the amount of redundant work done after a crash of one or more nodes.
We study the impact of our fault-tolerance mechanism on application efficiency,
both on the Dutch DAS-2 system and using the European testbed of the EC-funded
project GridLab.},

important in application areas like groupware and for runtime support
for parallel computing. We examine the performance of different
multicast based methods for maintaining the consistency of distributed
data depending on the network topology and concurrency.

Our prototype software implements ordered, reliable multicasts on top
of the unreliable IP broad- or multicast with three different
methods (Master-Slave, Token Exchange on Demand, Totem Single
Ring). This paper shows measurement results for the efficiency and 
scalability of the three methods in different topologies.

The measurements confirm earlier analytical results. Totem behaves
well in large networks with many concurrent senders. The overhead of
Token on Demand and of the Master-Slave algorithm is almost the same.
Also we could not find an indication for the often-read opinion that
the Master-Slave approach scales worse because of the central
bottleneck.}},

OPTabstract = {Simulating protein folding thermodynamics starting
purely from a protein sequence is a grand challenge of computational
biology. Here, we present an algorithm to calculate a canonical
distribution from molecular dynamics simulation of protein
folding. This algorithm is based on the replica exchange method where
the kinetic trapping problem is overcome by exchanging noninteracting
replicas simulated at different temperatures. Our algorithm uses
multiplexed-replicas with a number of independent molecular dynamics
runs at each temperature. Exchanges of configurations between these
multiplexed-replicas are also tried, rendering the algorithm
applicable to large-scale distributed computing (i.e., highly
heterogeneous parallel computers with processors having different
computational power). We demonstrate the enhanced sampling of this
algorithm by simulating the folding thermodynamics of a 23 amino acid
miniprotein. We show that better convergence is achieved compared to
constant temperature molecular dynamics simulation, with an efficient
scaling to large number of computer processors. Indeed, this enhanced
sampling results in (to our knowledge) the first example of a replica
exchange algorithm that samples a folded structure starting from a
completely unfolded state. }, URL =
