\begin{abstract}
The uptake of distributed infrastructure by scientific applications has been limited by the availability of extensible, pervasive and simple to use abstractions. Effective abstractions are required at multiple levels -- development, deployment and execution stages of scientific applications. The Pilot-Job abstraction has been 
shown to be an effective abstraction to address many requirements of scientific applciations. Howeever there are multiple Pilot-Job abstractions which are often tied to a specific infrastructure.  In this paper, we introduce a SAGA-based Pilot-Job which supports a wide range of application types and is usable over a broad range of infrastructure, i.e. is both general-purpose and pervasive.  Emerging distributed infrastructure such as Clouds provide different resource provisioning models from classical Grids. This introduces new opportunities for distributed applications and the support of dynamical execution models. In this paper, we discuss how the
SAGA-based Pilot-Job has been used for different application types and supports concurrent usage across
multiple heterogeneous distributed infrastructure.

Several classes of applications are well suited for distributed
environments. Probably the best known and most powerful examples are
those that involve an ensemble of decoupled tasks, such as simple
parameter sweep applications~\cite{1239909}.

\emph{Pilot jobs} is a concept initially pioneered by Condor Glide-In, which
has been used by many communities to increase the predictability
and time-to-solution of such applications. A pilot job allows the execution 
of jobs which the necessity to queue each individual sub-job. The pilot job itself
is a regular Grid job, which is started through a Grid resource manager, such as
the Globus GRAM.

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) is a high-level, easy-to-use API for 
accessing distributed resources. Unlike other common pilot job systems SAGA BigJob 
(i) natively supports MPI job and (ii) works on a variety of back-end systems, 
generally reflecting the advantage of using a SAGA-based approach.

Discuss PilotJob:
- How Traditionally Used (mostly deployment time)
- How traditionally bound to a single platform and system

Recently, the usage of virtualization and the usage of on-demand virtual machines
become increasingly popular. These so-called infrastructure-as-a-service clouds have
different advantages compared to traditional Grid systems: users are provided
with a greater flexibility and have the ability to customize their virtual machine
environment. At the same time virtual machines are well isolated from each other. More and
more the need to integrate traditional Grids and Clouds arises.

%from autonomic HPC Grid/Cloud paper
Developing and running applications in such a hybrid and dynamic computational 
infrastructure presents new and significant challenges. These include the need for programming 
systems that can express the hybrid usage modes and associated runtime trade-offs and adaptations, 
as well as coordination and management infrastructures that can implement them in an efficient 
and scalable manner. Key issues include decomposing applications, components and workflows, 
determining and provisioning the appropriate mix of Grid/Cloud resources, and dynamically scheduling 
them across the hybrid execution environment while satisfying/balancing multiple, possibly changing 
objectives for performance, resilience, budgets and so on.
