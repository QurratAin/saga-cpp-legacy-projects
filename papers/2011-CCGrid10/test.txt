The Condor pool used as one of the resources in scenarios A2 and A3 should be generally
perceive as a collective heterogeneous resource in itself. \tc on Condor pool depends on
an resultant availability of particular resources requested by an application to join a pool.
A load of each individual cluster implicates a queue time of Pilot-Jobs and is a main factor
deciding about a current size of a pool during an experiment. In the conducted experiment
showing scalability of a Condor resource this situation when a Pilot-Job is queued, although
often occured in real, was avoided in purpose to obtain comparable results,
Figure~\ref{fig:performance_8replica_grid_cloud_condor}. The time to complition consists a
startup time, which is the same for each tested configuration of Condor pool and
equals 331 sec on average, a sub-jobs placement, computing and cleanup time.
