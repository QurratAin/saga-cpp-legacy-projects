**the advantage of using dare scripts as opposed to using native SAGA api scripts. 
->the advantages from dare scripts comes from the advantages of using bigjob. The relationship is not made clear enough in this paper.
->Dare is not just a set of scripts, it has application classes and workflows (reusability) generic scenarios and reusability are easily achievable. At this point we do not have everything sorted out yet.
**** Bring sharath in for this point

**** Sharath needs to be available for the next point section 2.2/2.3
**** Sharath needs to be available to answer: "what are the interfaces to the dare framework"
**** 

* For SM: Two approaches: (i) documentation on DARE website, (ii) show integration of MR with PJ (iii) Sharath to provide
a few paragraphs which talk about DARE e.g., Where does BigJob ends and where does DARE begin? and Definitions.

* YYE has lock on section 2 and 3 till Fri
* Next week 9pm Wednesday
