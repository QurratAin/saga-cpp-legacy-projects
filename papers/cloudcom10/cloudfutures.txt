Abstractions for Life-Science Applications on Clouds

Shantenu Jha, Andre Luckow

Although multiple enterprise applications have made effective use of
Clouds, the barriers to the development of large-scale
high-performance scientific applications that can utilize Clouds in an
extensible and scalable fashion remain high.  Developing logically
and/or physically distributed applications at large-scales is
fundamentally a difficult undertaking; developing them for emerging
platforms such as Clouds is made harder due to the lack of commonly
acceptable and widely used programming models and application-level
abstractions.  Additionally, several of the challenges -- such as
coordination of multiple components, that face scientific applications
on traditional distributed environments such as Grids, carry-over to
cloud environments, even though the implementations of the solutions
will be different.

Based upon a recently submitted paper to ACM Computing Surveys
http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sjha/select_publications/dpa_surveypaper.pdf
we present a comprehensive analysis of the usage of production
distributed infrastructure, explore abstractions that exist as well
as those that should be provided to better support the effective
development, deployment, and execution of large-scale (scientific)
high-performance applications. The advantages of such abstractions
vary from better utilization of underlying resources to the easier
deployment of applications, as well as lowered development effort.  We
have taken the first steps to extending this analysis to include
Programming and Systems abstractions for Dynamic, Distributed and
Data-Intensive Applications (See: http://wiki.esi.ac.uk/3DPAS).

Building upon this theoretical framework, we are now developing these
abstractions and applying them to speed-up and support life-science
applications, such as those arising from the analysis requirements of
the next-generation sequencing machines and ensemble-based computing
for better drug delivery.  We present some initial implementation of
these abstractions on Azure and FutureGrid/XD.  The ultimate goal of
our work is to enable a wide range of existing, emerging and novel
life-science applications to better and effectively utilize cloud
platforms.
