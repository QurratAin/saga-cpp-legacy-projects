 The need for a community-backed interface standard,extensibility
 [...]

 \jhanote{(i) What are the requirements, (ii) How does the API meet
 them, (iii) Why this works (compare and contrast to other API types),
 and (iv) what has been done before?}

 The argument is not Open-source versus proprietary code but open
 standards. \jhanote{The Comingled Code: Open Source and Economic
 Development, by Josh Lerner and Mark Shankerman, MIT Press}

 \jhanote{SJ thinks we should have a schematic. Hartmut thinks of a
 picture which shows the API ``from the above''.. Andre to take first
 crack. AM to reorganize.}


 \subsection{Use Cases and Scope}
  - apps\\
  - access layer\\
  - tools\\
  - context to other APIs and standards (boundary conditions for scope)


 \subsection{Design Objectives (first class)}
  - top-down\\
  - simplicity / 80:20 rule\\
  - cross cutting look-and-feel\\
  - extensibility / capability packages\\

  - high level UML diagram\\


 \subsection{Capabilities, Extensibility and Evolution}
  - discuss extensions just shortly, leave discussion of actual extensions to
  3.5 etc.\\
  

 \subsection{Syntax and Semantics}


 \subsection{Architectural Constraints on Implementations}
   (glue to next section?)

 \jhanote{Explain why we have the classic 3-level architecture}
