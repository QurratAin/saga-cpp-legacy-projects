OPTabstract = {Simulating protein folding thermodynamics starting
purely from a protein sequence is a grand challenge of computational
biology. Here, we present an algorithm to calculate a canonical
distribution from molecular dynamics simulation of protein
folding. This algorithm is based on the replica exchange method where
the kinetic trapping problem is overcome by exchanging noninteracting
replicas simulated at different temperatures. Our algorithm uses
multiplexed-replicas with a number of independent molecular dynamics
runs at each temperature. Exchanges of configurations between these
multiplexed-replicas are also tried, rendering the algorithm
applicable to large-scale distributed computing (i.e., highly
heterogeneous parallel computers with processors having different
computational power). We demonstrate the enhanced sampling of this
algorithm by simulating the folding thermodynamics of a 23 amino acid
miniprotein. We show that better convergence is achieved compared to
constant temperature molecular dynamics simulation, with an efficient
scaling to large number of computer processors. Indeed, this enhanced
sampling results in (to our knowledge) the first example of a replica
exchange algorithm that samples a folded structure starting from a
completely unfolded state. }, URL =
