	Abstract = {The Reliable Server Pooling~(RSerPool) protocol
suite currently under standardization by the IETF is designed to build
systems providing highly available services by mechanisms and protocols
for establishing, configuring, accessing and monitoring pools of server
resources. But RSerPool is not only able to manage pools of redundant
servers and facilitate service failover between servers: it also
includes sophisticated mechanisms for server selections within the
pools. These mechanisms make RSerPool useful for the application in
load balancing and distributed computing scenarios. As part of our
RSerPool research and to verify results of our simulation model in
real-life scenarios, we have created a complete implementation
prototype of the RSerPool framework. In this paper, we will give a
detailed description of the concepts, ideas and realizations of our
prototype. Furthermore, we will show performance issues raised by the
management of large servers pools, as it is necessary for load
balancing or distributed computing scenarios. We will explain the
algorithms and data structures we designed to solve these challenges
and finally present a rough performance evaluation that verifies our
concept.},

@techreport{SXST06,
	Abstract = {ggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) in conjunction with the
  Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP) [9] provides a high
  availability data transfer mechanism over IP networks.  ASAP uses a
  handle-based addressing model which isolates a logical communication
  endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the
  binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP
  address(es) which normally constitutes a single point of failure.

  In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a
  pool, providing full transparent support for server-pooling and load
  sharing.  It also allows dynamic system scalability - members of a
  server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting
  the service.

  ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level
  redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol
  (SCTP) RFC2960 [3].  Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST
  have an accompanying transport mapping document.  It should be noted
  that ASAP messages passed between PE's and ENRP servers MUST use the
  SCTP transport protocol.

  The high availability server pooling is gained by combining two
  protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user
  interface for pool handle to address translation, load sharing
  management, and fault management while ENRP defines the high
  availability pool handle translation service.},

@techreport{J05,
	Abstract = {The new Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) was originally standardised
for the transport of signaling messages  originating from the Common Channel
Signaling System No.7 (SS7)  over IP based networks. Nonetheless, SCTP
is a general purpose IP-based reliable transport protocol which is connection oriented
and offers message based data transfer. It supports multiple independent
message streams and flexible data delivery mechanisms. In contrast to TCP,
SCTP protocol endpoints support multiple addresses (multihoming), and therefore
an endpoint may be reached via different and possibly redundant network paths.
Several SCTP enhancements, e.g. for partially reliable message transfer [82], are
currently being proposed, and it is conceivable that SCTP is a suitable transport
protocol for many established and future applications [5, 20].
In this thesis, the behaviour and performance of SCTP was investigated within
different scenarios. A suite of tools were developed to this end: in a testbed
environment, a Unix-based protocol implementation named sctplib was created
for demonstrating SCTP fairness towards TCP, and the applicability of SCTP for
signaling transport was investigated.
Discrete event-based simulation models of the SCTP data path and some control
path elements were created and validated against the results from the testbed
experiments. These models were later enhanced to investigate the simultaneous
use of several available paths (also named load sharing). From an operator perspective,
load sharing is desirable for signaling transport at high network loads,
even though it requires substantial protocol adaptations. Load sharing mechanisms
from the literature were evaluated, and a number of modifications of these
algorithms were suggested and evaluated, as well.
It could be shown that the modifications of the existing load sharing algorithms
that were developed within the scope of this dissertation indeed lead to an
optimisation of the load sharing algorithms so far proposed, both in terms of
overall throughput and maximum message delay that can be expected.},

@conference{Cristian88,
	Abstract = {The author describes his system model and failure assumptions by precisely specifying the processor group membership problem. He then gives two protocols for solving this problem. The protocols provide all correct processors with constituent views of the processor group membership. They also guarantee bounded processor failure detection and join processing delays despite any number of performance failures that do not cause network partitioning. The first protocol provides very fast processor failure detection but can require a significant message traffic overhead, even when no failures occur. To reduce this overhead, the author derives the second protocol, which has a (provable) minimal message overhead in the absence of failures but provides a longer failure detection delay and is more complex. He concludes by comparing his approach with other known approaches},

@techreport{Vaidya94b,
	Abstract = {{This report deals with the design and evaluation of a
 ``two-level'' failure recovery scheme for distributed systems.  In
 our previous work we motivated a ``two-level'' recovery approach that
 tolerates the more probable failures with a low overhead, and less
 probable failures with possibly higher overhead. The two-level
 approach can achieve a smaller overhead as compared to traditional
 recovery schemes. The contributions of this report are summarized
 below:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item We present and evaluate a ``two-level'' recovery scheme that is
   suitable for a network of workstations, each workstation having a
   local disk. The recovery scheme presented in the report can
   tolerate transient processor failures with a low overhead, while
   other failures require a larger overhead.  The report presents
   analysis of the average (expected) task completion time using the
   proposed scheme.  This scheme has been implemented on a
   workstation cluster. Our analysis indicates that the proposed
   two-level recovery scheme can achieve better performance as
   compared to existing ``one-level'' recovery schemes.
 \item The report also evaluates the impact of checkpoint latency on the
   performance of the recovery scheme. To our knowledge, no analysis
   of the performance impact of checkpoint latency has been carried
   out previously.
 \item Experimental measurements of checkpoint latency and checkpoint
   overhead for four applications are presented.
 \end{itemize}

	Abstract = {{<B>An eye-opening look at the new computer revolution and the coming transformation of our economy, society, and culture.</B><BR><BR>A hundred years ago, companies stopped producing their own power with steam engines and generators and plugged into the newly built electric grid. The cheap power pumped out by electric utilities not only changed how businesses operated but also brought the modern world into existence. Today a similar revolution is under way. Companies are dismantling their private computer systems and tapping into rich services delivered over the Internet. This time it's computing that's turning into a utility. The shift is already remaking the computer industry, bringing new competitors like Google to the fore and threatening traditional stalwarts like Microsoft and Dell. But the effects will reach much further. Cheap computing will ultimately change society as profoundly as cheap electricity did. In this lucid and compelling book, Nicholas Carr weaves together history, economics, and technology to explain why computing is changing\&\#151;and what it means for all of us.}},

@phdthesis{fielding00,
	Abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.

Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.

This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web.

REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

@article{JZCSW03,
	Abstract = {Grid computing emerges as effective technologies to couple geographically distributed resources and solve large-scale computational problems in wide area networked. The fault tolerance is a significant and complex issue in grid computing systems. Various techniques have been investigated to detect and correct faults in distributed computing systems. Unreliable fault detection is one of the most effective techniques. Globus as a grid middleware manages resources in a wide area network. The Globus fault detection service uses the well-known techniques based on unreliable fault detectors to detect and report component failures. However, more powerful techniques are required to detect and correct both system-level and application-level faults in a grid system, and a convenient toolkit is also needed to maintain the consistency in the grid. A fault-tolerant grid platform (FTGP) based on an unreliable fault detector and the Globus fault detection service is presented
 in this paper. The platform offers effective strategies in such three aspects as grid key components, user tasks, and high-level applications.},

	Abstract = {A grid consists of high-end computational, storage, and network resources that, while known a priori, are dynamic with respect to activity and availability. Efficient scheduling of requests to use grid resources must adapt to this dynamic environment while meeting administrative policies. In this paper, we describe a framework called SPHINX that can administrate grid policies, and schedule complex and data intensive scientific applications. We present experimental results for several scheduling strategies that effectively utilize the monitoring and job-tracking information provided by SPHINX. These results demonstrate that SPHINX can effectively schedule work across a large number of distributed clusters that are owned by multiple units in a virtual organization in a fault-tolerant way in spite of the highly dynamic nature of the grid and complex policy issues. The novelty lies in use of effective monitoring of resources and job execution tracking in making scheduling decisions and fault-tolerance - something that is missed in today's grid environments. },

	Abstract = {Initial versions of MPI were designed to work efficiently on multi-processors which had very little job control and thus static process models. Subsequently forcing them to support a dynamic process model suitable for use on clusters or distributed systems would have reduced their performance. As current HPC collaborative applications increase in size and distribution the potential levels of node and network failures increase the need arises for new fault tolerant systems to be developed. Here we present a new implementation of MPI called FT-MPI that allows the semantics and associated modes of failures to be explicitly controlled by an application via a modified MPI API. Given is an overview of the FT-MPI semantics, design, example applications and some performance issues such as efficient group communications and complex data handling.},

	Abstract = {The generic, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of the grid requires a new from of failure recovery mechanism to address its unique requirements such as support for diverse failure handling strategies, separation of failure handling strategies from application codes, and user-defined exception handling. We here propose a grid workflow system (grid-WFS), a flexible failure handling framework for the grid, which addresses these grid-unique failure recovery requirements. Central to the framework is flexibility by the use of workflow structure as a high-level recovery policy specification. We show how this use of high-level workflow structure allows users to achieve failure recovery in a variety of ways depending on the requirements and constraints of their applications. We also demonstrate that this use of workflow structure enables users to not only rapidly prototype and investigate failure handling strategies, but also easily change them by simply modifying the encompassing workflow structure, while the application code remains intact. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our framework using a simulation, demonstrating the value of supporting multiple failure recovery techniques in grid systems to achieve high performance in the presence of failures.},

	Abstract = {The notion of computational resiliency refers to the ability of a distributed application to tolerate intrusion when under information warfare (IW) attack. This technology seeks an active strengthening of a military mission, rather than protecting its network infrastructure using static defensive measures such as network security, intrusion sensors, and firewalls. Computational resiliency involves the dynamic use of replication, guided by mission policy, to achieve intrusion tolerance so that even undetected attacks do not cause mission failure; however, it goes further to dynamically regenerate replication in response to an IW attack, allowing the level of system assurance to be restored and maintained. Replicated structures are protected through several techniques such as camouflage, dispersion, and layered security policy.

	Abstract = {MPI implementations that support the highest level of thread safety for user programs, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, are becoming widely available. Users often expect that different threads can execute independently and that the MPI implementation can provide the necessary level of thread safety with only a small overhead. The MPI Standard, however, requires only that no MPI call in one thread block MPI calls in other threads; it makes no performance guarantees. Therefore, some way of measuring an implementation's performance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of performance tests that are motivated by typical application scenarios. These tests cover the overhead of providing the MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE level of thread safety for user programs, the amout of concurrency in different threads making MPI calls, the ability to overlap communication with computation, and other features. We present performance results with this test suite on several platforms (Linux cluster, Sun and IBM SMPs) and MPI implementations (MPICH2, Open MPI, IBM, and Sun).},

	Abstract = {Parallelism in file systems is obtained by using several independent server nodes supporting one or more secondary storage devices. This approach increases the performance and scalability of the system, but a fault in one single node can make the whole system fail. In order to avoid this problem, data must be stored using some kind of redundant technique, so that it can be recovered in case of failure. Fault tolerance can be provided in I/O systems by using replication or RAID based schemes. However, most of the current systems apply the same technique of fault tolerant at disk or file system level.
This paper describes how fault tolerance support can be used by MPI applications based on PVFS version 2, as well-know parallel file system for clusters. This support can be applied to other parallel file systems with many benefits: fault tolerance at file level, flexible definition of new fault tolerance scheme, and dynamic reconfiguration of the fault tolerance policy.},

We are developing MetaLoRaS, an efficient two-level MetaScheduler for non-dedicated environments, which assigns PVM and MPI applications according to an estimation of the turnaround time in each particular cluster.
The main MetaScheduler goal is to minimize the average job turnaround time in a non-dedicated environment. The efficiency of MetaLoRaS depends on the prediction accuracy of the system and its ability to take decisions according to changes in local workload.
In this paper we present different Metascheduling techniques that take the dynamics of the local workload into account and compare their effects on system performance. We evaluate the prediction accuracy in relation to the low-level queues sizes. Finally, we analyze the relationship between prediction accuracy and system performance.},

MPI-2 semantics provide MPI_Put, MPI_Get and MPI_Accumulate operations which can be used to implement read-modify-write functionality. The different strategies yield varying performance benefits depending on the underlying one-sided implementation. We use HPCC Random Access benchmark which primarily uses read-modify-write operations as a case study for evaluating the different implementation strategies in this paper. Currently this benchmark is implemented based on MPI two-sided semantics. In this work we design and evaluate MPI-2 versions of the HPCC Random Access benchmark using one-sided operations. To improve the performance, we explore two different optimizations: (i) software based aggregation and (ii) hardware-based atomic operations. We evaluate our different approaches on an InfiniBand cluster. The software based aggregation outperforms the basic one sided scheme without aggregation by a factor of 4.38. The hardware based scheme shows an improvement by a factor of 2.62 as compared to the basic one sided scheme.},

@article{Amir95,
	Abstract = {Fault-tolerant distributed systems are becoming more
                important but, in existing systems, maintaining the
                consistency of replicated data is quite expencive. The
                Totem single-ring protocol supports consistent
                concurrent operations by placing a total order on
                broadcast messages. This total order is derived from
                the sequence number in a token that circulates around
                a logical ring imposed on a set  of processors in a
                broadcast domain. The protocol handles reconfiguration
                of the system when processors fail and restart or the
                network partitions and remerges. Extended Virtual
                Synchrony ensures that processors deliver messages and
                configuration changes to the application in a
                consistent total order system-wide. An efficient flow
                control mechanism enables the Totem single-ring
                protocol to achieve message ordering rates
                significantly higher than the best prior total
                ordering protocols},

	Abstract = {Although Web-based information systems (WISs) have been widely used by enterprises to accomplish business tasks through the Internet, there is little research on designing a flexible access control and delegation model for WISs. In this paper, we design a user-to-user and role-to-role delegation model (called X-RDR model) for WISs. The authorization and delegation policies are encoded in XML and the granularity of control can be as small as a text-field or button. Additionally, the proposed model supports single-step delegation, multi-step delegation, multiple delegation, partial delegation, separation of duties, and cascading revocation. A prototype was also implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.},

	Abstract = {Divide-and-conquer is a well-suited programming paradigm for
parallel Grid applications. Our Satin system efficiently schedules the
fine-grained tasks of a divide-and-conquer application across multiple clusters
in a grid. To accomodate long-running applications, we present a fault-tolerance
mechanism for Satin that has negligible overhead during normal execution, while
minimizing the amount of redundant work done after a crash of one or more nodes.
We study the impact of our fault-tolerance mechanism on application efficiency,
both on the Dutch DAS-2 system and using the European testbed of the EC-funded
project GridLab.},

	Abstract = {{Consistent maintenance of distributed data is
important in application areas like groupware and for runtime support
for parallel computing. We examine the performance of different
multicast based methods for maintaining the consistency of distributed
data depending on the network topology and concurrency.

Our prototype software implements ordered, reliable multicasts on top
of the unreliable IP broad- or multicast with three different
methods (Master-Slave, Token Exchange on Demand, Totem Single
Ring). This paper shows measurement results for the efficiency and 
scalability of the three methods in different topologies.

The measurements confirm earlier analytical results. Totem behaves
well in large networks with many concurrent senders. The overhead of
Token on Demand and of the Master-Slave algorithm is almost the same.
Also we could not find an indication for the often-read opinion that
the Master-Slave approach scales worse because of the central
bottleneck.}},
