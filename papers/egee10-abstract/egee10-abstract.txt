o TITLE:  Providing a Uniform and Standard Access Layer to the EGI
Software Stack via SAGA

o SHORT OVERVIEW (max. 500 chars):

It has been proposed that EGI will adopt ARC, UNICORE and gLite. SAGA
- an OGF standard provides a uniform access layer to the EGI stack, as
it works with UNICORE and gLIte, and extensions to ARC (via BES) are
planned and in the works via BES.

o DETAILED ANALYSIS (max. 1000 chars):



o IMPACT (max. 1000 chars):

- providing a common interface to the 3 functionally equivalent
layers, is the right design/architecture to adopt
- This will make tooling easier
- This will make applications development easier
- Provide example of GANGA-DIANE and Lattice QCD example. Discuss
how this has been extended 'out' to TeraGrid but will be extended
to ARC
- Request Steve to put in a few words about how the SD has been used 

o CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK (max. 1000 chars):

o WEBSTIE (mandatory):

http://saga.cct.lsu.edu (would the GangaSAGA wiki be better? It's rather technical)

o KEYWORDS (mandatroy):

o PRIMARY AUTHORS:

o Ole Weidner Andre Merzky, Steve Fisher, Shantenu Jha, 

o CO-AUTHORS:  

o TRACK CLASSIFICATION (1 or more):
