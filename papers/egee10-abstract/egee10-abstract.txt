o TITLE:  

Providing a Uniform and Standardised Access Layer to the European Grid Middleware Effort with SAGA.

o SHORT OVERVIEW (max. 500 chars):

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA), has proven its ability to provide a simplified and uniform multi-language access layer to heterogeneous grid middleware stacks more than once. Support for a European middleware stack is underway, as SAGA already provides support for UNICORE (via GridSAM) and gLite, and extensions to ARC via OGSA-BES as well as generic DRMAA support are planned and under development. First SAGA application integration tests within the EGEE have proven success.


o DETAILED ANALYSIS (max. 1000 chars):



o IMPACT (max. 1000 chars):

- providing a common interface to the 3 functionally equivalent
layers, is the right design/architecture to adopt
- This will make tooling easier
- This will make applications development easier
- Provide example of GANGA-DIANE and Lattice QCD example. Discuss
how this has been extended 'out' to TeraGrid but will be extended
to ARC
- Request Steve to put in a few words about how the SD has been used 

o CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK (max. 1000 chars):

o WEBSTIE (mandatory):

http://saga.cct.lsu.edu (would the GangaSAGA wiki be better? It's rather technical)

o KEYWORDS (mandatroy):

o PRIMARY AUTHORS:

o Ole Weidner Andre Merzky, Steve Fisher, Shantenu Jha, 

o CO-AUTHORS:  

o TRACK CLASSIFICATION (1 or more):
