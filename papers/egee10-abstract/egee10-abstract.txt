(1) TITLE:  

Providing a Uniform and Standardised Access Layer to the European Grid Middleware Effort with SAGA.


(2) SHORT OVERVIEW: Short description and scope of presented work. (max 500 chars)

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA), has proven its ability to provide a simplified and uniform multi-language access layer to heterogeneous grid middleware stacks more than once. Support for a European middleware stack is underway, as SAGA already provides support for Unicore and gLite, and extensions to ARC via OGSA-BES as well as generic DRMAA support are planned and under development. First SAGA application integration tests within the EGEE have proven success.


(3) DETAILED ANALYSIS: Detailed description of the work planned or achieved. Should include technical details, challenges faced, and technical or other problems that you had to overcome etc. (max 1000 chars)

The C++/Python implementations of OGF's SAGA standard (GFD-R-P.90) are successfully being deployed and used to provide a unified grid access layer for scientific applications running on the TeraGrid (Globus, Condor, LSF, PBS), UK-NGS (GridSAM) and even cloud infrastructures like Amazon's EC2. We're now focusing on the development of extensions (adaptors) that enable SAGA to interface with three of the major European grid middleware projects: gLite, Unicore and ARC. Unicore access through GridSAM and parts of the gLite stack are already available. Support for further gLite components as well as a generic OGSA-BES extension that will allow native access to both, Unicore and ARC are currently under development and expceted to be avilable soon. To prove viability of this effort, SAGA has been integrated with GANGA and DIANE and successfully executed Lattice QCD jobs simultaneously on EGEE and TeraGrid infrastructure.


(4) IMPACT: Description of the work results. Quantitative information should be provided where applicable. Justification of the significance of the work and how it impacted the domain should be provided. Moreover the originality of the work should be compared to similar existing activities. (max 1000 chars)

Although this work is still under development, its long-term impact on the European middleware can be derived from our ongoing work that currently fosters interoperability between the US TeraGrid, UK-NGS and NAREGI, as well as from first EGEE application integration tests. We have shown that using SAGA as a high-level middleware access layer not only makes application development and tooling eaiser (and faster), but also naturally results in portability and interoperability on a local, national and international level, e.g., as demonstrated at EGEE'09, a simple SAGA plugin enabled Ganga/Diane not only executes jobs on local CERN infrastructure, but also to the TeraGrid - an infrastructure that previously wasn't accessible through Ganga/Diane. Similar advances are being made with on UNICORE-based DEISA Infrastructure. Extending further (e.g. to NAREGI and ARC), becomes  a matter of developing the appropriate SAGA adaptors and the application doesn't need to be modified again.

(5) CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK: Short concluding summary. Description of the plans for further development/work to be performed and the technical challenges and other problems that you anticipate to overcome in order to achieve the expected goals. (max 500 chars)

We believe that our current and future work will align well with future European efforts in a sense that it provides the right technology with the right level of abstraction that is required to leverage the development of truly distributed and portable applications in an expanding heterogeneous environment. In order to support a seamless integration, our future work will focus on additional bindings to gLite (WMS & CREAM) as well as native OGSA-BES and DRMAA bindings.
