(1) TITLE:  

Providing a Uniform and Standardised Access Layer to the European Grid Middleware Effort with SAGA.


(2) SHORT OVERVIEW: Short description and scope of presented work. (max 500 chars)

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA), has proven its ability to provide a simplified and uniform multi-language access layer to heterogeneous grid middleware stacks more than once. Support for a European middleware stack is underway, as SAGA already provides support for Unicore and gLite, and extensions to ARC via OGSA-BES as well as generic DRMAA support are planned and under development. First SAGA application integration tests within the EGEE have proven success.


(3) DETAILED ANALYSIS: Detailed description of the work planned or achieved. Should include technical details, challenges faced, and technical or other problems that you had to overcome etc. (max 1000 chars)

The C++/Python implementations of OGF's SAGA standard (GFD-R-P.90) are successfully being deployed and used to provide a unified grid access layer for scientific applications running on the TeraGrid (Globus, Condor, LSF, PBS), UK-NGS (GridSAM) and even cloud infrastructures like Amazon's EC2. We're now focusing on the development of extensions (adaptors) that enable SAGA to interface with three of the major European grid middleware projects: gLite, Unicore and ARC. Unicore access through GridSAM and parts of the gLite stack are already available. Support for further gLite components as well as a generic OGSA-BES extension that will allow native access to both, Unicore and ARC are currently under development and expceted to be avilable soon. To prove viability of this effort, SAGA has been integrated with GANGA and DIANE and successfully executed Lattice QCD jobs simultaneously on EGEE and TeraGrid infrastructure.


(4) IMPACT: Description of the work results. Quantitative information should be provided where applicable. Justification of the significance of the work and how it impacted the domain should be provided. Moreover the originality of the work should be compared to similar existing activities. (max 1000 chars)

- providing a common interface to the 3 functionally equivalent
layers, is the right design/architecture to adopt
- This will make tooling easier
- This will make applications development easier
- Provide example of GANGA-DIANE and Lattice QCD example. Discuss
how this has been extended 'out' to TeraGrid but will be extended
to ARC
- Request Steve to put in a few words about how the SD has been used
