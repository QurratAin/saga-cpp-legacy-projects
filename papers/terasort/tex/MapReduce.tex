{\center {MapReduce \\
 \ 
}}

The SAGA MapReduce framework concentrates on processing large-scale dataset tasks implementable in heterogeneous environments supported by SAGA, so the application is not tied to any infrastructure [1]. Therefore, SAGA-MapReduce can work with different job scheduling systems like Globus, Condor and distributed file systems like HDFS, KFS and can be utilized in combination for performing MapReduce tasks.Mappers: In order to use the Mapper, the declared Mapper class must be registered in the framework and declared in the job description of MapReduce. A user-specified mapper function is defined to emit intermediate key value pairs. To use this Map Function it has to be declared as a Mapper in the Job Description for MapReduce and must be registered with the framework. Reducers: Similar to the Mapper, the declared Reducer class must be registered in the framework and declared in the job description of MapReduce. The intermediate key and value pairs generated in the Map Phase serve as the input Key In and Value In for the Reduce Phase, so these must match with the type of the intermediate keys and values of the respective Mapper class used for generating the input for this reducer. Key and Value pairs generated by Reducer after this phase denote the output type of the final keys and values. Partitioners: The declared Partitioner class must also be registered in the framework and declared in the job description of MapReduce. When processing the input data by Mapper, the generated intermediate keys will get partitioned across reduce tasks using function. By default, this framework applies a partitioning function that returns the hash value of the input key modulo to the number of partitions. However, in some cases a different partitioning scheme might be required.
