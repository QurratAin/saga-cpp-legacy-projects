1. Hybrid work
- JoCS: To finish this year
>> By November: Jeff: Ch 2.5 & 4 ; Nayong: Ch 3 & 5
>> by December: Revision by Shantenu and Dimitris (Ch 2 & 4)
% To Shantenu: Please take a look at when Nayong and Jeff finishes
- JSME Journal Paper: Not any action for now.
Conference paper in Japan is automatically shifted to this paper and is under revision process. In case of much to change, may need to put more details on replica sampling + interpolation schemes...

2. Framework development
- Hybrid framework document under writing (implementation of workflow)
>> Shall start development as soon as writing is done
- UCOMMS: Nothing particular

3. Conference plans 2012
- Hybrid: AIAA CFD conference
>> Held on 25 - 28 Jun 2012, Sheraton New Orleans
>> Deadline for Abstract: 17-Nov-2011
(http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=230&lumeetingid=2226&viewcon=other1485&id=1485)
>> Action Plan: Think about the item this weekend and prepare the abstract next week
>> Topic of interest: Multi-species fluid (with constrained MD modelling for multi-species fluid) for simulating the micro actuator / micro nozzle
% May need to include Dimitris
- Framework: Consideration when implementation is done
>> Which conference? Further discussion needed.
>> Any recommendation for submission?
- UCOMMS: N/A

4. New international project?
- Hybrid simulations; Multi-physics framework
>> Action plan:
(Shantenu and Nayong) brainstorm during SC; send a CV (Shantenu)
(Jeff) talk with director (Dr. Bengt Persson) for possible candidates
(Jeff) try to invite Shantenu for a talk and a deeper discussion
