1. plan from UCOMMS on journal paper - framework development for their application
% planned to be the end of this year
% overlapping part with us: they run the emsemble simulation (or parametric study) -- plans to use BigJob, they may request the full procedure handled by the workflow + raw-level dataflow between components (scp or gridftp)
% Nayong is expected to join as a co-author
% we can contribute via rough application-specific framework development (or workflow) -- need to participate in an upcoming UCOMMS meeting (through the teleconference) as a potential collaborator, to discuss the design and components of
the framework

2. hybrid framework design
> objectives: general (or generic) interface to attach many kinds of
middleware/software (data management, runtime, compilation, workflow)
% shall cover general issues -- security problem (for users from different groups); some application examples; use of grid resources; data management among distributed user/resources
> first step: read the paper up to chapter 2, fill chapter 3 by adding which ''specific softwares'' we will use for our examples and how we will implement our functions
(https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/saga-projects/papers/coupled-simulations/eScience11/Coupled_Framework.tex)
> next step: start the development according to this
rough structure (after the discussion next week)

3. Paper revision
% Jeff is needed to Participate in their meeting this Friday, asking what is going on
