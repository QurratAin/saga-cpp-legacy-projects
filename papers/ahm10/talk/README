"Software is largely a service industry operating under the persistent
but unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing industry." 
-- Eric Raymond, "The magic cauldron" (http://catb.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/)

This is not only true in the industry, but probably even more in academia! 

There are two themes that we should follow in the SAGA/Sustainability context:

I. Efforts we make to make SAGA sustainable 

I.a Strong community-driven standard

I.b Strategic deployment-agreements with big infrastructure providers. 

I.c

I.d Standard + Implementation allow functional extensions (e.g. Advert, Messaging, etc.)
This allows SAGA to grow with technology and potentially prevents it from becoming 'obsolete'.
(This is SAGA's horizontal extensibility) 


II. SAGA as key technology to develop sustainable distributed software systems

II.a. Adaptor concept allows to adapt an application to future Grid/Cloud 
middlewares without the need to change the application code. This can help an
application to survive more than one generation of distributed/CI systems. 
(This is SAGA's vertical extensibility)

II.b 




Of course, theme II depends on theme I since it would be hard to sell SAGA as 
a key technology for sustainability if it wouldn't be sustainable itself. This
should probably be the opening remark of the talk and both themes should be 
described subsequently. Personally, I would put more weight on II -- ideally 
with some application examples. What would be good candidates for this?
