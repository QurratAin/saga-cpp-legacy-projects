1. JoCS
-- Dimitris will give the feedback: if not until end of this week, Jeff will send a mail again to ask for his acceleration (specify deadline as Feb 15th). As soon as getting his feedback, Jeff will update it to the LaTeX file
-- Jeff will change Abstract and merge Chapters 6 + 7 in 1-2 days
Abstract change:
clearly say what has been done (what's the basis for saying 'accurate' and 'efficient'), what is our novelty (contribution)
also mention that this work has been done under the high-performance computing resources
change 'interial' to 'inertial'
-- Shantenu and Nayong will read the paper and make corrections
-- Next conversation on Feb 15 (or that week), going through chapters one by one
-- Submission before the end of this month


2. AIAA
-- Jeff and Nayong Will have the detailed plan at a separate meeting, talk about how Brian is to give the actual contribution
-- Shantenu will take a look at the current extended abstract


3. Framework development
-- What is the features of our framework (functionality), how we enable/implement those functions (shall we adopt other softwares, or develop our own from the scratch?)
-- Refer to MorCo, Muscle (read the paper), what capabilities we can adopt from those
-- Jeff proposes the submission to e-Science conference (maybe distributed multiscale workshop or other sessions)


4. ETC
-- AJK paper which is automatically submitted to the special edition of 'Journal of Materials Sciences and Technology' has been excluded from the publication (reason: they failed to get two solid reviews on our paper within time slot). So I requested to turn it to the regular submission and will add minor correction on the paper (changing figures for more clarity). Let me update with any news.
