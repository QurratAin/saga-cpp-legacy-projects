\LHead{What is SAGA}
\large

\textbf{\color{DarkBlue} OGF Standard: } The Simple API for Grid Applications
(SAGA) is an official OGF standard (GFD-R-P.90) that describes a high level,
object-oriented API for distributed application development. SAGA provides
abstractions for the three fundamental functionalities in distributed
computing environments: job handling, data handling and communication.

\textbf{\color{DarkBlue} The SAGA Implementations: } There are several independent 
implementations of the SAGA API for different programming languages. The two 
most prominent ones are XXX's jSAGA (Java), VU's JavaSAGA (Java, Python) and LSU's
SAGA (C++, Python).
