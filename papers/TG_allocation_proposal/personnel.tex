% \textbf{Dr Andrew Sherman} Dr. Sherman provides HPC support via the Yale Provost's Office for faculty and students, and is himself an expert on linear algebra methods in high performance computing.

% The present TeraGrid TRAC
% proposal contains two areas in which we will be collaborating with
% colleagues at Yale. These include biomedical research areas concerned
% with neurovascular modelling and stimulation, using HemeLB and patient
% specific HIV therapy based on rapid and accurate determination of
% protease-inhibitor binding affinities; and also in the determination
% of unstable periodic orbits based on the HYPO4D package. In both these
% areas, Dr. Sherman will lead and co-ordinate the participation of
% other Yale colleagues. He will contribute to our effort to improve the
% pre-conditioning of the variational relaxation procedure in order to
% enhance numerical convergence on candidate UPOs.  On 8 October 2009,
% the Presidents of Yale \& UCL signed a five-year collaboration
% agreement designed to provide for a deepening allianceÂ§ between the
% two universities. In its initial phases, currently underway, this will
% focus on advancing biomedical research and healthcare on a global
% scale, through joint scientific research, clinical and educational
% effort. As the alliance widens, it is anticipated that more academic
% areas will become part of this formal agreement.

% One central area of immediate and longer term concern is sharing of
% computational resources and facilities. The UCL-Yale consortium aims
% to conduct international science through sharing of resources on both
% sides of the Atlantic. The current proposal will help us to build
% joint computational effort in relevant research areas, with reciprocal
% resources being made available in UK and EU via DEISA and related
% resources. In addition, as part of their alliance, Yale and UCL are
% exploring ways to link each others' sites via an international high
% speed network.

% \begin{comment}
% Yale \& UCL are planning to link each others' sites via an
% international high speed network in 2010, funding for which will come
% from the two institutions, UK Government and EU (as part of the ELIXIR
% project which will develop sustainable data infrastructures across
% Europe). JA.NET (the UK's education and research network,
% http://www.ja.net) will provide the 10Gb/s dedicated connectivity via
% their LightPath (http://www.ja.net/services/lightpath) link
% procurements to DANTE (DANTE Delivery of Advanced Network Technology
% to Europe; http://www.dante.net), crossing under the Atlantic to
% Internet2 and hence on to Yale \& TeraGrid.

% \subsection{Associated Technical Developments, Collaborations \& Other High
% Performance Computing Resources}

% We plan to release the next version of our grid middleware Application Hosting Environment (AHE) in the second half of 2010 \cite{zasada2009,coveney2007}, during the proposed TRAC allocation.  The AHE provides simple graphical and command line interfaces to run applications on resources provided by grid computing infrastructures in addition to local campus-based clusters, while hiding from the user details of the underlying middleware in use by the distinct resource providers.  We are engaged in integrating AHE with a metascheduling framework, based on a computational mechanism design, which is mediated by software agents, to efficiently allocate work between a set of resources based on cost minimization and run time optimization.  The patient-specific clinical simulation work proposed in this TRAC will be supported by our plans to integrate support for SPRUCE (a system developed at Argonne National Labs for urgent computing by allowing users to run emergency jobs) within the AHE client interface, so that jobs submitted with SPRUCE tokens use the mechanisms provided by SPRUCE to preempt the current workload on a machine. We also plan to introduce a mechanism to host workflows in the AHE as virtualized applications, composed by orchestrating the execution of other AHE hosted applications. The purpose of workflow management systems is to automate common time consuming tasks that the scientist carries out when performing \emph{in silico} studies. With the planned developments, we can interact with workflows involving simulation pre-processing, launch and post-processing via the AHE in the same way as with a single application. This work is being done in collaboration with developers of the GSEngine workflow management tool within the European Union's (EU) Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) project.

% In addition to the requested TeraGrid allocation, we currently have an allocation of 4.04 million Allocation Units (AUs) on the UK's Cray XT4 supercomputing resource associated with the EPSRC grant (EP/F00521/1) entitled ``Large scale lattice-Boltzmann simulation of liquid crystals'' for materials science research. Within the EU VPH Virtual Community project, we annually receive an allocation of 2.0M CPU hours on the EU's DEISA grid for our work in the bio-medical sciences domain.  (This computational allocation has been awarded to Coveney (PI); award number EU FP7-ICT-2007-5.3 223920 funded by the European Union with a start date of 06/01/2008 and expiration date of 11/30/2012).  We have been successful in the DEISA Extreme Computing Initiative (DECI) calls successively for the past several years, most recently gaining 700,000 CPU hours for our computational science activities.  (The most recent DECI computational allocation was awarded to Coveney (PI); award number EU RI-222919 funded by the European Union with a start date of 01/01/2009 and expiration date of 01/31/2010).  Use of the AHE and software from the SAGA project has allowed our research team to inter-operate between high performance computing resources in the US, UK and the EU.  Additionally, within our grid middleware development activities, we are working on a new mechanism, termed as Audited Credential Delegation, to allow controlled access to a single grid certificate for a group of users, authenticated by their local institutional security credentials, facilitated by AHE. This approach is being developed to address issues related to the scalability of the current X.509 certificate-based authentication model, which relies on each individual user obtaining and managing his/her own grid certificates. This project is being funded by the UK EPSRC grant (EP/D051754/1) entitled ``User-Friendly Authentication and Authorisation for Grid Environments''.

\emph{We need to ensure we address point raised last time, by citing 
reciprocal activities in UK/EU, and equivalnet utilization of DEISA REOSOURCEes.}
We have an allocation of X million AUs on UK's Cray XT4 supercomputer associated
with the UK EPSRC Grant(LSLBLC NO.) which
will support the projects within the bio-materials science domain. We plan
to perform complementary activities on EU's DEISA grid 
in the biomedicine domain, where the work is
supported by EU FP6 and FP7 funding and the new UCL-Yale initiative. 
We have been successful in the DEISA Extreme Computing Initiative (DECI)
calls successively for the past two years in gaining access to some of the
biggest supercomputers in the EU. Use of SAGA and AHE 3.0 will allow us to
seamlessly inter-operate between high performance computing resources in the
US and EU.
