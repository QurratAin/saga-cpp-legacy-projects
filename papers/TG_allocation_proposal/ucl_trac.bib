  abstract = {The molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method
	has been investigated with the aim of achieving a statistical precision
	of 1 kJ/mol for the results. We studied the binding of seven biotin
	analogues to avidin, taking advantage of the fact that the protein
	is a tetramer with four independent binding sites, which should give
	the same estimated binding affinities. We show that it is not enough
	to use a single long simulation (10 ns), because the standard error
	of such a calculation underestimates the difference between the four
	binding sites. Instead, it is better to run several independent simulations
	and average the results. With such an approach, we obtain the same
	results for the four binding sites, and any desired precision can
	be obtained by running a proper number of simulations. We discuss
	how the simulations should be performed to optimize the use of computer
	time. The correlation time between the MM/GBSA energies is approximately
	5 ps and an equilibration time of 100 ps is needed. For MM/GBSA,
	we recommend a sampling time of 20-200 ps for each separate simulation,
	depending on the protein. With 200 ps production time, 5-50 separate
	simulations are required to reach a statistical precision of 1 kJ/mol
	(800-8000 energy calculations or 1.5-15 ns total simulation time
	per ligand) for the seven avidin ligands. This is an order of magnitude
	more than what is normally used, but such a number of simulations
	is needed to obtain statistically valid results for the MM/GBSA method.

  abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition
	is a major focus of current anti-AIDS drug discovery and development
	programs, comprising 17 of the 31 Food and Drug Administration-approved
	compounds. The emergence of the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)
	class of compounds provides a highly specific and structurally diverse
	set of drugs, which act noncompetitively to perturb normal RT function.
	Despite a relatively rich set of crystallographic data of RT in various
	states, details of the allosteric modulation of RT dynamics by NNRTIs
	are lacking. Capturing this inhibitory mechanism could fuel the design
	of more effective inhibitors at the NNRTI site and also drive the
	identification of novel allosteric sites. To address this, we have
	performed multicopy molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RT in
	the presence and absence of the NNRTI nevirapine (cumulative total
	simulation time, 360 ns). By comparing the collective motions of
	the MD and crystallographic structures, we demonstrate that the chief
	effect of NNRTIs is to constrain a key rigid-body motion between
	the "fingers" and "thumb" subdomains of the p66 subunit. We show
	that the NNRTI binding pocket (NNIBP) is proximal to the hinge points
	for this essential motion, and NNRTIs therefore act as "molecular
	wedges," sterically blocking the full range of motion. To explain
	how this impaired movement might result in the experimentally observed
	loss of polymerase activity, we show that the motion influences the
	geometry of key catalytic residues on opposite faces of the NNIBP.
	From a methodological point of view, our results suggest that the
	multicopy MD simulation approach is very useful when studying proteins
	that perform such large conformational changes.},

  abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance
	simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds
	of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of
	processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual
	desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential
	functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to
	novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods
	used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics
	force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with
	the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature
	and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation
	across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational
	free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a
	roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based
	on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting
	the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed.
	Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications
	to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting
	particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language.
	The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and
	discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence
	analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software
	BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.},
