%\section{Results From Prior Awards}

% \jhanote{This should list out (i) prior awards and what they were for, (ii) scientific progress and understanding that arose and (ii) publications as a result of prior awards.}

% \jhanote{Yaakoub/Joohyun: Our award/project number for last years TRAC is MCB090174.
%   Please mention resource usage statistics, be sure to mention that we've used 100\% well before
%   the expiry. Mention allocation swapping between machines}

% \jhanote{Publications arising from clast TRAC: (i) Project 1: JCTC and a publication on ABF are in the works; (ii) Riboswtich -- in addition to NAR, we have ECMLS and others (Joohyun to fix), (iii) UCL is listed in prior.tex so ok, (iv) Project 4, TeraGrid-talk, DEISA Interop talk, and publication in process, but also reference Cybertools publications -- ccgrid and others}


This group has multiple publications arising from earlier TRAC Awards. Initial results from Project 1 supported by the most recent TRAC award to PI Jha (MCB090174) was selected as the cover article of a leading scientific journal~\cite{jctc_cover}.  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.28\textwidth}

Using previous TRAC allocations, we have performed all-atom MD simulations for the SAM-I riboswtich study.  We have reported our scientific results in recent conferences~\cite{ecmls10}, as well a recently published journal article in the prestigious Nucleic Acids Research\cite{SAM-I-NAR2009} (Impact Factor $>$ 7.0). On the basis of these publications, we have enhanced our scope by expanding our interests \& simulations to other riboswitches, such as TPP riboswitches and recurrent RNA structural motifs such as K-turn, towards a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of SAM riboswitches.  Also, we added the complementary computational approaches such as RNA secondary structure prediction in addition to all-atom MD simulations, and our initial effort was presented in the workshop, "Emerging Computational Methods for the Life Sciences" held in conjunction with ACM HPDC 2010\cite{ecmls10}.

We have also used previous TRAC allocation for CO$_2$ sequestration studies and reservoir characterization studies. These studies were composed of running an ensemble of independent simulations followed by an anaylsis step, and iterating until a termination criteria is met.  Since the simulations are independent, they can be distributed across TeraGrid resources, with a sufficiently abstract and sophisticated workflow manager.  We have begun developing an rudimentary distributed autonomic framework -- Lazarus ~\cite{gmac}, using which we are able to select multiple TeraGrid machines concurrently, dynamically optimize the work-load and gain deep insights. This is a natural continuation of our award winning work in 2008 (TeraGrid 2008 Performance Challenge Award)~\footnote{\url{http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sjha/select_publications/tg08-performance-award.pdf}}. Beside the obvious science results ~\cite{TG10yye00}, we learned a great deal about scale-out behavior and management of ensembles of large scale simulations, the need for fault tolerance and autonomic behavior, as well as the promising possibilities of combining Grid and Cloud environments. This work has resulted in several publications \cite{Cloud1,Cloud2,MSEScience,TG10yye00} and presentations as well as a Masters degree~\cite{Elkhamra2009}.
