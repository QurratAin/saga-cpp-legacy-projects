PySAGA is the project concerning the specification of the Python-SAGA 
language binding. The result will be a Python specification which is 
independent of the SAGA reference implementation (Cpp or Java). Later on 
a java specific backend will be added with the help of Jython. This part 
of the project is called JySAGA
