PySAGA is the project concerning the specification of the Python-SAGA 
language binding. The result will be a Python specification which is 
independent of the SAGA reference implementation (Cpp or Java). Later on 
a java specific backend will be added with the help of Jython. This part 
of the project is called JySAGA

Python program -> Python-Saga binding -> SAGA reference implementation

The source code, documentation, tests and pretty much everything is 
nowhere near alpha phase, so use at own risk. Not that it will hurt your 
system, but it probably just won't work.
