On questions or comments, you may want to contact the SAGA mailing list at
<saga-users@cct.lsu.edu>, or the author at <andre@merzky.net>.  

Fixes and extensions are always welcome, as long as they keep the code simple:
the purpose of this code is not to draw the mandelbrot set, but to demonstrate
the use of SAGA :o)
