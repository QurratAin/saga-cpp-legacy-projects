  * @section introduction Introduction
  * Dispatching many simple jobs to execute many model simulations has a severe 
  * limitation: all simple jobs must queue at the resource management system 
  * potentially causing a slowdown of the overall application. We overcome this 
  * slowdown using an efÔ¨Åcient and adaptive job dispatching schema, which allows 
  * the clustering of model simulations processes before submission.
