This readme describes the DayInLife application.

DayInLife (short for "A Day in the Life of a Grid Application") is a very small
example of a application migrating itself to a different resource. All it is
doing is to increment a counter, which is stored in a file. After that it 
respawns itself either on the same or on a different resource. Each instance
increments the counter exactly once.

The purpose of this example is to show, how SAGA can be used to build a 
framework encapsulating all the boilerplate code needed to enable a similar
scenario. The application itself just uses the functionality provided by the 
framework.

dayinlife can take upto 3 commandline parameters:

    dayinline nextrm nexthost maxiterations

where nextrm: is the resource manager to use to spawn the next instance 
              (default: localhost)
      nexthost: the next candidate host to run the next instance 
                (default: localhost)
      maxiterations: the maximum number of iterations (default: 2)

dayinlife currently forwards all given arguments to its next instances.

Starting dayinlife without any arguments respawns a second instance on the 
localhost. After execution the current directory should contain a logfile and 
a single file counter.out. counter.out should contain a single '2' (the 
actual counter value).
