INTRODUCTION

  This is the ganga IBackend for SAGA. It should run out of the box if,
  and only if you have SAGA & the SAGA Python bindings installed on your
  system and added to you PYTHONPATH.

  If you have no idea what that means, you probably want to check out the
  SAGA website: http://saga.cct.lsu.edu

  If you have any questions, feel free to send me an mail:

EXAMPLE: 

  Here's an example how to submit a job to a Globus GRAM2 gatekeepr
  through ganga/saga:

  j = Job()
  j.backend = SAGA()
  j.backend.rm_url = "gram://qb1.loni.org"

  j.application.exe = "/bin/sleep"
  j.application.args = ['60']

  j.submit()
