 ... A deployment tool for SAGA and FAUST ...

Mephisto is a simple Perl script for SAGA and FAUST deployment. It downloads 
all required packages from a central repository, builds and installs them. 
Installing the whole SAGA/FAUST software stack is now as easy as:

perl mephisto.pl install –target-dir=/opt/saga/


Its simplicity and platform independency makes Mephisto a practical tool to 
carry out remote deployment through a remote job manager like GRAM or even SSH:

ssh qb.loni.org /usr/bin/perl mephisto.pl install –target-dir=/work/oweidner/meph

We maintain a simple web-based repository for Mephisto on this webserver. It 
should always contain the latest stable an tested versions of all packages - 
including SAGA and FAUST. Mephisto is configured to use our repository by 
default, but if you want you can set up your own Mephisto repository within 
minutes on your own server.
