Prerequisites:
- SAGA with CPR, File, and Job package
- SAGA python bindings (PYTHONPATH must be set accordingly)
- Migol adaptor
- NAMD installation

The REMDgManager can be run as follows:

python main.py --type=REMD --configfile=remd_manager.config

TODO:
- relative paths for file staging
- automatic directory creation 
- replica exchange: determination of new temperature currently fails
- optimization of transfer: do not transfer initial conditions again after each exchange step

Description on REMDManager-v1.0.py
- The purpose of this version is to keep the logics of REMD only
- This assumes the simplest scenario (no migol adaptor and thus no CPR/Migol and using globus gram adpator)
- prepare_MAMD_config() : NPT.conf is changed if necessary (means after exchange step, new temperatures are assigned)
- get_energy() : energy is pulled from "output.txt" and this file name should be set when initialized
- do_exchange() : exchange is attempted here
