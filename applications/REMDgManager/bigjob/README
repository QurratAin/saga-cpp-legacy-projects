SAGA BigJob/Glide-In framework
Based on advert service
Prerequisites:
- SAGA with File and Job package
- Optional:
       * SAGA CPR for Migol
- SAGA Python bindings (PYTHONPATH must be set accordingly)


0.) Setup SAGA
- install SAGA/Globus on all resources that supposed to run tasks 
- Optional for Glide-In: 
    Make sure the advert service is configured to use PostgreSQL by checking $SAGA_LOCATION/share/saga/saga_adaptor_default_advert.ini:
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert]
          name      = default_advert
        
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert.preferences]
          dbtype    = postgresql
        
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert.preferences.postgresql]
          # The set of parameters used in the dbconnect string 
          # for PostgreSQL is the same as accepted by the PQconnectdb 
          # function from the libpq library (see here: 
          # http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT)
          dbconnect = dbname=advertdb;host=fortytwo.cct.lsu.edu;port=5432;user=SAGA;password=SAGA_client


1) BigJob-Agent (Must run on every resource):
- advert_launcher.sh/advert_launcher.py
- poll advert service for jobs
- executes and monitors jobs

* Configure advert_launcher:
    $ cp advert_launcher.sh.template advert_launcher.sh
    
    This is the agent, which launches the sub-jobs. It ensures that the environemnt is correctly set (MPI version, NAMD version etc.)
    If necessary adjust enviornmental settings in this file. 

* Launch Configuration:
    $cp advert_launcher.conf.template advert_launcher.conf

    Adjust shell, mpi version, if necessary

2.) Run test application:
Look at example source:
$ vi example.py
=> adjust replica_agent location for launching the big_job: 
re_agent = <PATH_TO_RE_AGENT> + "/advert_launcher.sh"

=> adjust working directory

Run example
$ grid-proxy-init
$ python example

TODO:
- cancelation of jobs via Globus adaptor does not work correctly
