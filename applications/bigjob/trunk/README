*********************************************************************************

THIS IS THE OLD DEPRECATED VERSION OF BIGJOB. PLEASE USER VERSION LOCATED IN:

generic/

DIRECTORY.

*********************************************************************************


=====================================================
SAGA BigJob/Glide-In framework

Prerequisites:
- Python 2.5 or higher
- Python 2.4 is NOT supported. It was reported to work, but requires the manual installation of UUID package: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uuid/
- Python 2.3 is NOT supported. It was reported to work, if the UUID and Subprocess package are manually installed. 
There is no official backport of the subprocess package. The subprocess.py can however be manually 
copied from a Python 2.4 or higher installation.


- SAGA with File, Job and Advert package
- Supported adaptors:
	- default local adaptors
	- Globus
	- AWS (exp.)
	
- SAGA Python bindings (PYTHONPATH must be set accordingly)
- SAGA/Boost must be compiled with a supported Python version. To find out which Python-bindings you have in your SAGA installation, check the 

$SAGA_LOCATION/lib directory.

The python bindings are in a directory python<version>, e.g.

python2.6.2

Setup

0.) Setup SAGA
- install SAGA/Globus on all resources that supposed to run tasks 
- Make sure the advert service is configured to use PostgreSQL by checking $SAGA_LOCATION/share/saga/saga_adaptor_default_advert.ini:
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert]
          name      = default_advert
        
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert.preferences]
          dbtype    = postgresql
        
        [saga.adaptors.default_advert.preferences.postgresql]
          # The set of parameters used in the dbconnect string 
          # for PostgreSQL is the same as accepted by the PQconnectdb 
          # function from the libpq library (see here: 
          # http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT)
          dbconnect = dbname=advertdb;host=fortytwo.cct.lsu.edu;port=5432;user=SAGA;password=SAGA_client


1) BigJob-Agent (Must run on every resource):
- bigjob_agent_launcher.sh/bigjob_agent.py
- poll advert service for jobs
- executes and monitors jobs

* Configure advert_launcher:
    $ cp bigjob_agent_launcher.sh.template bigjob_agent_launcher.sh
    
    This is the agent, which launches the sub-jobs. It ensures that the environment is correctly set (MPI version, application binaries, etc.)
    If necessary adjust environmental settings in this file. 

* Launch Configuration:
    $cp bigjob_agent.conf.template bigjob_agent_launcher.conf

    Adjust shell, mpi version, if necessary

2.) Run test application:
Look at example source:
$ vi example.py
=> adjust bigjob_agent_executable location for launching the big_job: 
bigjob_agent_executable = <PATH_TO_RE_AGENT> + "/bigjob_agent_launcher.sh"

=> bigjob_agent.conf
must be located in execution directory of bigjob_agent

=> adjust working directory and other resource settings

Run example
$ grid-proxy-init
$ cd examples
$ python example-local.py


TODO:
- cancelation of jobs via Globus adaptor does not work correctly on all resources
