Montage Release Change History

3.2   05Sec2008    Nothing major, mostly little tweaks and bug fixes.
                   There are a few new utilities, most of which are not
		   ready to be generally advertised (or used).

3.1   21Sep2007    The updates in this release center mostly around using
		   Montage via mExec.  The archive access to SDSS has been
		   brought up to DR6 and full flux calibration is now done.
		   A problem with CAR projection (which can have very large
		   offsets as they often refer back to lat=0, lon=0) has been
		   dealt with, and mExec itself has been made more robust
		   and the output more instructive.

		   A few other bug fixes and enhances were also made:
		   mJPEG can now make images with a simple compass 'rose'
		   (showing N and E directions) and can make images for
		   FITS files where there is no valid WCS.

		   mTANHdr was made more robust, especially in dealing with
		   projections like CAR (when it is far away from the 
		   equator) where there are some gross overall distortions
		   (in addition to the fine distortions that mTANHdr is
		   really meant to address).


3.0   05Jan2007    The core system has not been changed much, though
		   there have been some additions and numerous small
		   tweaks.  The main emphasis has been on solidifying
		   Montage use in a distributed Grid environment to
		   allow the building of large-scale mosaics from
		   2MASS, SDSS, and DPOSS.

		   New Core Modules:
		     + mConvert
		     + mDiffFitExec
		     + mHdrTbl
		     + mTblSort


                   New Utilities:
		     + mArchiveList
		     + mArchiveGet
		     + mArchiveExec 
		     + mBestImage
		     + mCatMap
		     + mExec
		     + mFixNaN
		     + mHdr
		     + mJPEG
		     + mPix2Coord
		     + mRotate

                   Grid tools for Globus, Pegasus included in "grid" subdirectory

		   Additional Changes:
		   + mAdd: 
		     bug fixes; added averaging mode options
		   + mAddExec: 
		     new module to create series of tiled mosaics, 
		       instead of one large output image (mAdd)
                   + mBgExec: 
		     Memory bug fixes; improved handling for images 
		     with no corrections 
                   + mBgModel: 
		     Improved error handling; increased default 
		     iterations to 10000
		   + mDiff:
		     Improved error handling; decreased required
		     pixel area to include in calculations to 0.333
                   + mMakeHdr:
		     Added flag (-p) to set pixel scale; improved 
		     error handling
                   + mMakeImg:
		     Added 'region' and 'replace' modes
                   + mOverlaps:
		     Increased diff file name range
		   + mProjExec:
		     Automatically use mProjectPP when possible; 
		     output message updates; added flux scaling option;
		     added support for 'hdu' column in image table
                   + mProject, mProjectPP:
		     Added flux scaling option; added weight image and
		     HDU functionality; added option to force reprojection
		     of whole image, even if part of it is outside
		     region of interest
                   + mShrink:
		     Added "fixed size" mode
                   + mTANHdr:
		     Scaling/rotation now inherited from input header; 
		     increased number of points used in fit; check fit
		     for "all off-scale" condition; performance improvements

2.2   20Jul2004    Makefiles have been updated and the CFITSIO
                   library modified (see docs/ExternalLibraries.txt
                   for details) to allow the use of 64-bit addressing
                   (files larger than 2 GByte) on LINUX platforms.

2.1   01Jul2004    Changes have been made to several modules.
                   The biggest change, however, is the addition
                   of mTANHdr (and associated changed to mProjectPP)
                   which allow the fast reprojection of non-tangent-plane
                   projections if they can be approximated as distorted
                   TAN images.

2.0.4 16Mar2004    mAdd no longer allocates the entire output 
                   image up front, and so uses even less memory.
                   -level-only flag has been added to mBgModel.

                   New module mShrink added to make scaled 
                   versions of an image (e.g. image with pixel
                   scale 5.5 times larger than the original)

                   New modules mRadHit and mRadHitExec added
                   to try and remove "radiation hit" type 
                   artifacts from original unprojected images
                   by comparing pixel values to local medians.

                   New modules mDagTbls and mConcatFit added to
                   aid in GRID computing use of Montage.  The 
                   first generates a set of tables (lists of 
                   images, overlap analysis) for use in setting
                   up a batch processing run.  The second combines
                   the output of difference fitting (presumably
                   in this context done via separate threads) into
                   a single table for use by mBgModel.

2.0.3 04Feb2004    mAdd has been updated to better manage memory 
                   and a fast reprojection (plane-to-plane) module
                   has been added (mProjectPP).

2.0.2 13Jan2004    Fixed several problems with 'boundaries' library
                   (used by mMakeHdr). Also fixed a realloc() bug
                   in mMakeHdr.

2.0.1 25Nov2003    Fixed background matching (specifically mDiff
                   bug) and made various other minor changes.

2.0   17Sep2003    Status file option added to all modules
                   to support GRID (Montage-G DAG) processing.


                   Migrated from Montage 1.7.1:

                   Fixed a couple of bugs in mProject: FITS 
                   reading was being done incorrectly (which 
                   caused occassional error conditions) and 
                   pixel "handedness" was sometime computed 
                   incorrectly for CD matrices.

1.7   29May2003    - Added checks for malloc return values in mAdd
                   - mBgModel now allows arbitrarily large 
                     number of iterations

1.6   24Apr2003    Support for DSS projection has been added.
                   All anomaly reports from 1.5 have been 
                   resolved.  Specifically:
                   - checkHdr.c is more robust (and handles DSS
                     headers properly
                   - checkWCS.c handles transposed lon/lat
                   - Minor changes to mImgtbl support routines
                   - mImgtbl checks for correct ordering of corners
                   - Added checks to see if template file lines
                     contained <CR><LF> syntax (ie, had been passed
                     through a PC)
                   - Added checks for svc_run() aborts due to a 
                     missing executable (eg if the mProjExec
                     executable existed but mProject didn't)
                   - Fixed bug in mGetHdr where it checked the
                     wrong argument for FITS header
                   - mHdrCheck now checks explicitly for a
                     missing input file
                   - Added specific checks to mProjExec to see if
                     the various files and directories on the command
                     line exist before calling mProject
                   - Fixed bugs in syntax for parsing -i and -o
                     arguments in mProject
                   - Added more debugging messages to mProject                  

1.5   18Mar2003    All anomoly reports have been resolved
                   and getopt() processing has been incorporated
                   into most of the modules to handle command-line
                   parameters.

1.4   24Jan2003    The background rectification software
                   has been debugged and modified slightly.
                   Minor modifications have also been made
                   to the reprojection code to avoid problems
                   with small-offset roundoff errors 
                   affecting the pixel overlap calculations.

1.3    1Oct2002    Workaround for bug in WCS library
                   affecting cylindrical projections;
                   fix for LINUX bug in svc control
                   library

1.2   25Sep2002    Initial LINUX port

1.1   27Jul2002    Updated pixel overlap to remove
                   repeated (within positional tolerance)
                   points.  Otherwise the Girard() 
                   calculation gets confused.

1.0   01Jul2002    Initial Limited Release
